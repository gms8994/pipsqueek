* pipsqueek-5.1.3
    10 Aug 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    The Birthday module has an update to the grammar and fixes a small bug
    related to inputting a username with a space after it.  The DateTime plugin
    received a patch to support timezones.  The WTF and Decide plugins were both
    added to the main distribution.  Thanks to Mark Stratman for all the above.
    A small patch in the Client.pm code which fixes a bug found when creating 
    a database for the first time.

* pipsqueek-5.1.2
    10 Aug 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    PipSqueek is now under version control with the 'subversion' repository
    system.  Future releases of pipsqueek will be tagged by the revision
    number in the repository.  Added the Babelize, Weather, and RSSGrabber
    plugins to the main distribution.  Also added the POE::Component::IRC
    module so that hannel prefixes other than '#' are supported properly.

* pipsqueek-5.1.1
    26 Apr 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> Message.pm,Plugin/Admin.pm:
    Thanks to the great help of Henri Vilminko I've updated PipSqueek to
    correctly handle channel prefixes other than '#' (such as those defined
    in RFC 2811).  Also added a new 'mode' and 'invite' command for admins
    (make sure to update your levels.conf file).  Support for '!channels' 
    will depend on POE::Component::IRC version >= 2.10 (

* pipsqueek-5.1.0
    07 Apr 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> Client.pm, Plugin/Misc:
    Wrote a powerful extension that allows administrators to 'merge' two
    seperate users into one.  This has been a requested item for some time.
    Occasionally pipsqueek will start storing separate data for a new user
    if you join the channel under a nickname that wasn't your original or 
    most recent /nick change.

    New plugin writers that want to use the merge extension must catch the
    special event 'pipsqueek_mergeuser' and then merge their stored data in
    whatever way seems fit.  All the core pipsqueek modules have been 
    modified to take advantage of the new change.

    * It is recommended that you set this command to a HIGH access level *
    * These settings are stored in the etc/levels.conf file for your bot *

    07 Apr 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> Plugin/*, Config.pm:
    Added a new API for how plugins define their configuration data.
    Plugin writers are now responsible for telling the configuration object
    about the keys they accept.  Also modified the behavior for module
    configuration so that the bot will first load the config file from the
    root directory and then will merge in updates from a local channel 
    config if it exists.  All core modules have been modified to take 
    advantage of the change.

    07 Apr 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> Plugin/PipSqueek.pm:
    Updated the levels.conf loading routine to support a global levels.conf
    file and merge in a local levels.conf file for your specific channel.

    07 Apr 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> Plugin/LinkGrabber.pm:
    Added a new configuration option which will let you increase the number
    of retrievable urls when using the bot in a private message context.

* pipsqueek-5.0.5
    05 Apr 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> PipSqueek/Client.pm:
    Added a regex that strips anything after a newline out of privmsg
    output, this can stop potential security holes from occuring where a
    script reads the output of an RSS feed or other non-controllable source
    Thanks to ps for reporting it - this behavior is configurable

* pipsqueek-5.0.4
    23 Mar 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> Plugin/Birthdays.pm:
    Fixed some issues with formatting of dates on output.
    
    23 Mar 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> Plugin/DateTime.pm:
    Added a plugin to report the current time and date on the server it is
    running on.
    

* pipsqueek-5.0.3

    17 Mar 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> Plugin/BlackJack.pm:
    Fixed an error where the bot would output an erroneous message if you
    doubled down and hit 21 exactly.

    16 Mar 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> Help.pm, Client.pm:
    Fixed a few path-related problems on Windows that stopped the bot
    from running properly.  Fixed a problem with the pipsqueek.conf
    not being loaded on Windows because it was a symlink to the
    Plugin/PipSqueek.conf file (from now on, just use pipsqueek.conf)
    Also added a message to Currency.pm that it may take a bit to 
    populate the database table on first run.
    Thanks to Stu <stu@better.domain.name> for pointing them out.

    16 Mar 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> INSTALL, Date/Parse:
    Date::Parse isn't available through ppm so I included it with the
    pipsqueek distribution.

    15 Mar 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> Birthdays.pm:
    Fixed up a problem where the match on usernames was case sensitive,
    also improved the output of the handler to display the day of the
    week and the year.

* pipsqueek-5.0.2

    15 Mar 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> Help.pm:
    When running pipsqueek for multiple channel configurations the Help
    module would not be able to load documentation from the root directory.

* pipsqueek-5.0.1
    
    14 Mar 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> Birthdays.pm, Currency.pm:
    Birthdays.pm had an invalid dependency on Date::Calc (not needed).
    Currency.pm had an error in the database table data - Just delete 
    the currency table from the database and rehash your bot to reload the
    correct data.

    14 Mar 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> PipSqueek.pm:
    Fixed levels.conf loading so it properly loads the file from the root
    directory if it doesn't exist in the configuration directory.

* pipsqueek-5.0.0

    12 Mar 2004; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    I really suck at writing changelogs, I should have updated this a week
    ago when I started rewriting the core of pipsqueek.  Some of the big
    changes are; all data is stored in sqlite databases now, there's a
    database abstraction layer to (sort of) mediate the amount of work
    required for a plugin writer to utlize it.  A lot of the way plugins
    and sessions interacted has been revamped - most of the interface is
    the same though.  The configuration module has been redesigned, instead
    of the goofy param() function, it creates an accessor for each data
    member.  The pipsqueek program can now be used to run multiple sessions
    with independent configuration, datafiles, plugins, etc.  That about
    sums up the majority of it I think...  There were numerous minor bugs
    fixed and some new functionality added to plugins.  Oh, and the new
    blackjack plugin (thanks for the inspiration Truckle) is a lot of fun!

* pipsqueek-4.0.1

    09 Jun 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net>
    lib/PipSqueek/Plugins/Stats.pm, bin/pipsqueek.pl:
    Fixed a bug in the cloaking feature whereby a user couldn't use the
    !rank command to get their own stats.  Also, if a user requests the
    stats for themselves by typing their username out, the 'sorry!' message
    is displayed to them.  Also fixed an error whereby the VERSION number
    wasn't updated to 4.0.0 at release time :x

* pipsqueek-4.0.0

    07 Jun 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> 
    lib/PipSqueek/Plugins/Stats.pm, misc files:
    Some minor touchups, a few typos caught, etc. Released.

    06 Jun 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> 
    lib/PipSqueek/Plugins/URLGrabber.pm, doc/INSTALL,
    lib/PipSqueek/Plugin.pm, *:
    Moved the URLGrabber to using URI::Find::Schemeless (much better than
    the crappy regex that was there before), updated INSTALL docs to note
    that it was required.  Also squashed a bug I thought had been fixed
    previously with the bot's nickname.  Prepped for release of 4.0.0

    01 Jun 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    Some big style cleanups all over the place, added a logo to the README
    file, rewrote the delegation handler for commands, improved the help
    documentation, etc..  Time to get started on a tutorial for module
    writing :-)

    31 May 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> 
    lib/PipSqueek/Plugins/Slap.pm, doc/INSTALL, lib/PipSqueek/Plugin.pm,
    lib/PipSqueek/Plugins/Admin.pm, etc/pipsqueek.conf:
    Slapping someone now allows more than one word as the 'thing' to hit.
    Added more install information and configuration information, also
    documented the configuration file itself.  Cleaned up the way kicks
    were handled.  Fixed a small bug in the connection setup whereby if
    the bots nickname was set, it wouldn't tell the config module that it
    was using the default 'PipSqueek'.  So any further attempts to match
    the bot's nickname would fail (nickname is nothing).

    30 May 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    Another large cleanup of the code, overhauled the semantics of the way
    pipsqueek tracks nicknames and maps them to their stats.  Squashed a
    lot of bugs related to various plugin modules, fixed up an error in
    the stats tracking that arose from the new nickname tracking code.
    Rewrote the stats module to take advantage of the new tracking, etc.

    27 May 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> doc/plugins/*, 
    lib/PipSqueek/Plugins/Help.pm, doc/README, doc/logo.txt:
    Wrote initial help for each event handler and finished Help interface.
    Added updated README file with better formatting, new credits to Cyon.
    Added doc/logo.txt with the original PipSqueek ascii art logo!

    26 May 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> doc/INSTALL:
    Added initial requirements, installation, configuration sections.
    Also added a section on installing perl modules

    25 May 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> doc/Changelog:
    Created Changelog (slightly modeled after gentoo's changelog format)

    11 May 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    A complete, 90% from scratch, rewrite of the code.  Improved module
    semantics, improved API, improved core, updated configuration, newer
    features, and much, much, more!


# It should be noted that the changelog prior to this is incomplete and most
# likely innaccurate too.  It is pieced together from development notes and
# snapshots of pipsqueek's homepage from the wayback machine ;)
# PipSqueek up to this point was mostly learning code, not release code.

* pipsqueek-3.2.2

    07 Oct 2002; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    Added quotes database using DBD::SQLite, cleaned up various warning
    messages, hacked in a feature to have the bot respond to handlers in a
    private message (useful for users that like to check their score or
    stats in private), added the math handler again after some cleanup of
    the exploitable code (still uses eval), misc bugfixes, etc...

* pipsqueek-3.2.1

    20 Jul 2002; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    Fixed an error that occured when the bot was restarted but no users
    had been added to the database yet.  Updated the handler loading so
    that the primary code can be in a single directory, and still be run
    for multiple channels.  Custom handlers will also be loaded from the 
    cwd you run pipsqueek in, and will override handlers already set

* pipsqueek-3.2.0

    17 Jul 2002; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    Lots of bugfixes, fixed an error in the ranking output that caused 
    incorrect ranks to be calculated, added a math evaluation module, added
    the ability to reload plugin modules on the fly, added online help, 
    added a command to list the commands available, and also updated and
    improved the usage/description info for all public and admin commands

* pipsqueek-3.1.0

    15 Jul 2002; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    Complete rewrite of 3.0b code, kept same module style but implemented a
    different API.  Created several additional modules for making the jobs
    of module-writers easier.  Patched POE::Component::IRC to make part
    messages work properly (or just use version 2.2 or later).  Made the
    handler modules more flexible (one module can handle several events).

* pipsqueek-3.0.0b

    03 Jul 2002; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    Complete rewrite of the 2.0 code.  PipSqueek now uses full-fledged perl
    objects as handlers.  Added new core code to accomodate the new handler
    formats, added a Users.pm and Settings.pm to move some of the code out
    of the primary pipsqueek.pl script.

* pipsqueek-2.0.0b

    13 Mar 2002; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    Cleaned up and released as an actual package.  Moved handlers to files
    defined outside of the main code (they just contain anonymous subs).
    Removed the !seen functionality since Epona botserv was providing it
    anyway.
    
* pipsqueek-1.4.0

    15 Sep 2001; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    Another complete rewrite removing a ton of excess code, and reducing 
    memory/processor usage. This version of pipsqueek also did away with
    the Net::IRC module in favor of POE::Component::IRC, a much more
    frequently  updated and stable module (thanks to a tip from #perl)

* pipsqueek-1.2.2

    26 Jul 2001; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    This was just a maintenance update that fixed a regex problem with the
    public command prefix when it was set to '.'.  The pipsqueek installer
    script was also enhanced slightly.

* pipsqueek-1.2.1

    25 Jul 2001; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    This version fixes a few minor formatting issues and integrates the 
    Chatbot::Eliza perl module to give the bot a truly unique personality!
    Also included with this release is an updated install script. 
    * This was the first public release of pipsqueek's code

* pipsqueek-1.1.0
    
    ?? ??? 2001; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
    Added language translations (canadian, eh?) and some prelim support for
    new commands... ???

* pipsqueek-1.0.0
* pipsqueek-0.3.0
