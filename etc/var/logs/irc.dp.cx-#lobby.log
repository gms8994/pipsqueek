1285090142: <PipSqueek> 
1285090825: <STLchan> yeah.  i ran like hell from BoA before i got hit with anymore bullshit

1285090892: <dp> thought you'd be interested in seeing that
1285090892: <PipSqueek> 
1285090946: <STLchan> first bullshit from BoA credit - they tried charging a late fee because i had paid my balance to $0 > 2 weeks within the due date.  they said i failed to pay in time because i paid EARLY
1285090947: <PipSqueek> 
1285090962: <STLchan> that got removed instantly, no questions asked when calling cust service
1285090962: <PipSqueek> 
1285091019: <STLchan> second bullshit - when i first opened the card, i had a dinged up credit and fico score and they gave me a limit of 8000.  after cleaning all that shit up and almost 10 years later, i had a 50k limit and a platinum card
1285091019: <PipSqueek> 
1285091036: <STLchan> they then, without notice, lowered my limit to 5k
1285091036: <PipSqueek> 
1285091051: <STLchan> when i called up, they said this was to "protect" me
1285091051: <PipSqueek> 
1285091064: <STLchan> i immediately closed the card
1285091066: <PipSqueek> 
1285091094: <STLchan> i cancelled my account.  had the manager cut me checks for the remaining balances of savings and checking.  the manager made a 13 cent error by giving me the interest i was due before it posted
1285091094: <PipSqueek> 
1285091114: <STLchan> i had boa collections calling me because, 1) my account was suddenly over drawn (savings acct)
1285091115: <PipSqueek> 
1285091123: <STLchan> 2) they couldnt' cover the overdraft from any other account
1285091123: <PipSqueek> 
1285091145: <STLchan> 3) since my accounts were closed, they didn't email or snail mail me until it went to collections
1285091145: <PipSqueek> 
1285091166: <STLchan> 4) i couldn't talk to anyone in customer service because they had no ability to pull information on closed accounts
1285091166: <PipSqueek> 
1285091188: <STLchan> i finally got a BoA customer serive executive on the phone - called and harassed HQ
1285091192: <PipSqueek> 
1285091212: <STLchan> he cleared it up finally.  but i did have to drop the threat of media and lawyers
1285091213: <PipSqueek> 
1285091252: <STLchan> the "fee" spiraled to a few thousand dollars because boa manager made a 13 cent mistake
1285091252: <PipSqueek> 
1285091382: <acr0nym> Heh.  Fun.
1285091382: <PipSqueek> 
1285091480: <STLchan> they went from no fee anything, good interest rates, great customer service to bat shit insane in a very very short time frame

1285182555: <tinfoil_> OMFG - someone just told me that they are going to retire servers.  I don't have to spend 2 days trying to track down what happened to missing boxes.
1285182555: <PipSqueek> 
1285182646: <dp> retire servers?
1285182646: <PipSqueek> 
1285182673: <tinfoil_> turn off
1285182673: <PipSqueek> 
1285182692: <dp> oh
1285182692: <PipSqueek> 
1285182697: <dp> is that a good thinig for you?
1285182697: <PipSqueek> 
1285182714: <tinfoil_> People would say "Hey, we don't need this server anymore" and turn it off without telling anyone outside their group
1285182714: <PipSqueek> 
1285182733: <dp> oh
1285182733: <PipSqueek> 
1285182735: <dp> ok, I got it
1285182735: <PipSqueek> 
1285182737: <tinfoil_> Yes, I have agents on every server in the company.  Also I'm in charge of automated discovery and inventory
1285182737: <PipSqueek> 
1285182743: <dp> they alerted you *before* turning them off
1285182743: <PipSqueek> 
1285182765: <tinfoil_> Before, after doesn't matter as long as it happens before I have to track them down
1285182765: <PipSqueek>

1285182770: <PipSqueek> 
1285182827: <tinfoil_> "Are you in charge of this server?  No?  Do you know who is? Etc..."
1285182827: <PipSqueek> 
1285182837: <tinfoil_> Too many cooks with their hands in the pot around here
1285182837: <PipSqueek> 
1285182935: <tinfoil_> We did find out a small faction of the support people decided that IT wasn't working for them, so one of the more tech savvey people put up a website for his team so they could coordinate and share information.   On a shared webserver on the internet without https.
1285182935: <PipSqueek> 
1285183002: <tinfoil_> I'm sure we're not the only company that has to deal with that shit
1285183002: <PipSqueek> 
1285183073: <dp> lol
1285183073: <PipSqueek> 
1285183123: <tinfoil_> Thankfully these people didn't have access to credit card numbers
1285183123: <PipSqueek> 
1285183157: <tinfoil_> Thankfully most sales people are too dense to come up with solutions like that
1285183157: <PipSqueek> 
1285183162: <fbx> personally, i don't think having your hand in the pot makes the soup tastes better. unless it's been washed in cooked bacon.
1285183162: <PipSqueek> 
1285183214: <tinfoil_> Even then, it depends on how big the pot is.
1285183214: <PipSqueek> 
1285183230: <fbx> yeah, i could see that
1285183230: <PipSqueek> 
1285184376: <STLchan> holy shit this place is fucking bullshit political and petty.  i just heard a snippet of something i said in a technical discussion escalated to client VP level, to our sales group back down to me as this god awful fucking emergency
1285184376: <PipSqueek> 
1285184413: <tinfoil_> ????  What did you say?
1285184413: <PipSqueek> 
1285184458: <STLchan> what i said "the system is in a degraded state.  there's a lot of janitorial tasks you need to do after an upgrade to get performance back into line.  today i'll do all that for you."  what went up was "the system is degraded.  what the fuck is going on?  why did we pay all this money for software, hardware and professional services?"
1285184458: <PipSqueek> 
1285184603: <STLchan> underqualified and unoccupied people with nothing better to do than to eavesdrop and spread fucking out of context rumors
1285184603: <PipSqueek> 
1285184633: <STLchan> now i have to go into hostile witness mode and journal everything i do with a timestamp
1285184633: <PipSqueek> 
1285184650: <dp> does that include chatting on IRC? :D
1285184650: <PipSqueek> 
1285184687: <STLchan> 2010092:14:44:40CST - told dp he's a fuckwhit
1285184687: <PipSqueek> 
1285184709: <dp> blahahaha
1285184709: <PipSqueek> 
1285184727: <STLchan> 20100922:14.47:20 - corrected timestamp on telling dp he's a fuckwhit
1285184727: <PipSqueek> 
1285185707: <STLchan> i need a non vendor non consulting job.  i miss not having to actually be productive... ever
1285185707: <PipSqueek> 
1285185911: <tinfoil_> Productivity is a myth.  It's all about how well you suck dick and take it up the ass these days.
1285185911: <PipSqueek> 
1285185930: <STLchan> what happened with your manager
1285185930: <PipSqueek> 
1285185935: <STLchan> or the meeting about your manager
1285185935: <PipSqueek> 
1285185939: <tinfoil_> Nothing yet
1285185939: <PipSqueek> 
1285185964: <tinfoil_> thought I'm not getting shit for working 50hr weeks anymore
1285185964: <PipSqueek> 
1285185983: <STLchan> 50 hours too much or too little?
1285185983: <PipSqueek> 
1285185990: <tinfoil_> too little
1285185991: <PipSqueek> 
1285186010: <tinfoil_> We were told at our performance reviews that we are expected to give 70+hrs a week 
1285186010: <PipSqueek> 
1285186035: <STLchan> did you get paper copy of that performance review?  that would have gone right to my lawyer.
1285186035: <PipSqueek> 
1285186064: <tinfoil_> Then we were shown this commercial during a team meeting:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaal1v-vLYQ and said that's what we're doing.
1285186064: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/7gFa (YouTube - Building Airplanes In The Sky)
1285186064: <STLchan> that's a violation of labor laws even if you are considered an exempt employee
1285186064: <PipSqueek> 
1285186065: <tinfoil_> It wasn't written down
1285186065: <PipSqueek> 
1285186087: <STLchan> exempt status used to apply only to management.  that's where the lawsuits, or rather the threat of lawsuits, get really fun
1285186087: <PipSqueek> 
1285186118: <STLchan> if you're exempt, not management, AND they put in writing that you're expected to work that EVERY week, not just occasionally during busy times
1285186118: <PipSqueek> 
1285186136: <STLchan> there's a very very good chance of success which will net you and your lawyer overtime pay
1285186136: <PipSqueek> 
1285186329: <STLchan> i wonder how well this stint at tripwire will serve me interviewing for a full time security admin position

1285187326: <PipSqueek>

1285187361: <PipSqueek> 
1285187507: <tinfoil_> STLchan - Check out Seattle.  And you'll have someone willing to watch your cats when you're not around.  :-)
1285187507: <PipSqueek> 
1285187595: <STLchan> yah that's another reason to get a non travel job.  cats are both 13 and starting to show their age a lil bit.  with 355 days logged at marriotts alone (don't stay there exclusively) well
1285187595: <PipSqueek> 
1285187602: <STLchan> i want to be there for em

1285187670: <STLchan> mike - you ever get your openvpn routing issues sorted out?
1285187670: <PipSqueek> 
1285187789: <tinfoil_> Yeah, but my OpenVPN is currently down.
1285187789: <PipSqueek> 
1285187800: <tinfoil_> My DynDNS broke and I've been too busy to fix it
1285187800: <PipSqueek> 
1285187846: <STLchan> this customer's guest wireless only allows 80 and 443 tcp and i was too lazy to reconfigure my openvpn so i'm bouncing everything through work's vpn :P
1285187846: <PipSqueek>

1285194294: <tinfoil_> ;-p
1285194294: <PipSqueek> 
1285195340: <STLchan> whoa
1285195340: <PipSqueek> 
1285195351: <STLchan> i'm not going to ask where you inserted your inline egg
1285195351: <PipSqueek> 
1285195522: <STLchan> that commercial seriously backfired in my mind.  if you're building an airplane in the sky you need to 1) beat the FUCK out of your project managers and 2) fire your executives
1285195522: <PipSqueek> 
1285195554: <STLchan> maybe call up every vendor and have them fire or reassign all your local sales reps
1285195554: <PipSqueek> 
1285196984: <tinfoil_> Yeah
1285196984: <PipSqueek> 
1285197000: <tinfoil_> That commercial is very dot.com
1285197000: <PipSqueek> 
1285197009: <tinfoil_> and so is the attitude
1285197009: <PipSqueek> 
1285197131: <tinfoil_> since when did lightbox become acceptable?
1285197131: <PipSqueek> 
1285197171: <tinfoil_> It's essencial a pop-up window, without the windoe
1285197171: <PipSqueek> 
1285197173: <tinfoil_> window
1285197173: <PipSqueek> 
1285197229: <STLchan> lightbox?
1285197229: <PipSqueek> 
1285197321: <tinfoil_> yeah, when you click on an image, and it brings up the image in a CSS overlay that covers the page you are on
1285197321: <PipSqueek> 
1285197365: <STLchan> ahhh
1285197365: <PipSqueek> 
1285197388: <STLchan> i don't mind that much unless it breaks mobile browsing
1285197388: <PipSqueek> 
1285197435: <tinfoil_> I'm just looking at gallery modules for my new website and like 80% of them use lightbox
1285197435: <PipSqueek> 
1285197436: <STLchan> hmm what else can you say about the EDS commercial.  it seems to imply that having developers and incomplete and untested systems in production is ok
1285197436: <PipSqueek> 
1285197438: <tinfoil_> I no want lightbox!
1285197438: <PipSqueek> 
1285197443: <STLchan> we should write a consensus rebuttal
1285197443: <PipSqueek> 
1285197507: <STLchan> and this was in a team meeting?  were they trying to inspire or warn you
1285197507: <PipSqueek> 
1285197532: <tinfoil_> inspire
1285197532: <PipSqueek> 
1285197551: <tinfoil_> My director is always "on"
1285197551: <PipSqueek> 
1285197552: <STLchan> wow.  did it work?  or did anyone else point out the glaring contradictions?
1285197552: <PipSqueek> 
1285197572: <STLchan> on what
1285197572: <PipSqueek> 
1285197576: <tinfoil_> Everyone in the group has had to work at weird hours at some point and when they emailed him, he replied within minutes every time
1285197576: <PipSqueek> 
1285197584: <tinfoil_> and not usually short replies
1285197584: <PipSqueek> 
1285197632: <STLchan> weirdest laptop issue ever encountered:  glidepad works at work.  glidepad does not work in the hotel
1285197632: <PipSqueek> 
1285197634: <STLchan> no fucking lie
1285197634: <PipSqueek> 
1285198046: <tinfoil_> to much semen?
1285198046: <PipSqueek> 
1285198111: <STLchan> even if there was a slathering on the surface of the hotel desk, i fail to see how it would make a difference?
1285198111: <PipSqueek> 
1285198126: <STLchan> same finger
1285198126: <PipSqueek> 
1285198135: * STLchan holds it out and wiggles it
1285198144: <STLchan> in my line of work i sendom need more than this
1285198144: <PipSqueek>

1285253645: <PipSqueek> ]3d0g: Prost!
1285254065: <acr0nym> Oh....
1285254065: <PipSqueek> 
1285254072: <acr0nym> I've got a BAD feeling about this:
1285254072: <PipSqueek> 
1285254079: <acr0nym> ------------------------------------------------
1285254079: <PipSqueek> 
1285254079: <acr0nym> Initial Problem Description:
1285254079: <PipSqueek> 
1285254079: <acr0nym> ------------------------------------------------
1285254079: <PipSqueek> 
1285254084: <acr0nym> Over the summer we installed a server/compute cluster and connected it to a gigabit port.  We do a lot of work on super computers at DOE and NSF and have a need to
1285254084: <PipSqueek> 
1285254087: <acr0nym> transfer files that are 10's or 100's of gigabtyes.  It is in ECAE 1B94.
1285254087: <PipSqueek> 
1285254090: <acr0nym> Can you give me a rough estimate of what I should expect in terms of performance from the gigabit port?
1285254090: <PipSqueek> 
1285254093: <acr0nym> We seem to be gettting much less than what we would have expected and are tracing down source and destination stages to determine where the bottleneck is.
1285254093: <PipSqueek> 
1285254118: <TeleCon> That doesn't sound good.
1285254118: <PipSqueek> 
1285254194: <acr0nym> Yeah.  It sounds like a painful nightmare, mostly.
1285254194: <PipSqueek> 
1285254304: <acr0nym> Like, "We don't guarantee a damn thing except that your NIC will report a gigabit connection."
1285254304: <PipSqueek> 
1285254333: <acr0nym> Perhaps you'd like to spend the tens of thousands of dollars to have your own OC-192 between the DOE and NSF and your location.
1285254333: <PipSqueek> 
1285254341: <TeleCon> lol
1285254341: <PipSqueek> 
1285255267: <TeleCon> what kind of throughput does the campus have to the outside world?
1285255267: <PipSqueek> 
1285255389: <]3d0g> Elebenty billion giggybits
1285255389: <PipSqueek> 
1285255412: <acr0nym> Actually, just 1, to the intarwebs.
1285255412: <PipSqueek> 
1285255426: <acr0nym> 10 to the FRGP, 1, I think to NLR, 1, I think, to I2.
1285255426: <PipSqueek> 
1285255758: <TeleCon> hm
1285255758: <PipSqueek> 
1285255836: <acr0nym> I'm pretty sure we QoS the crap outta gigabit, and, DOE and NSF are likely I2 or NLR, so, shared like crazy.
1285255836: <PipSqueek>

1285275791: <STLchan> indeed
1285275791: <PipSqueek> 
1285275809: <STLchan> it will but not in the high numbers of episodes type
1285275809: <PipSqueek> 
1285275822: <dp> interesting
1285275822: <PipSqueek>

1285275891: <PipSqueek> 
1285275909: <acr0nym> Do you get the feeling of some kinda bizarre "super-recursion" of the BBC's Sherlock being in response to House?
1285275909: <PipSqueek> 
1285275919: <acr0nym> "super-recursion" feeling, that is.
1285275919: <PipSqueek> 
1285275924: <acr0nym> Or, maybe, "meta-recursion"
1285275924: <PipSqueek> 
1285275981: <acr0nym> And, season 7 of House is what started Monday.
1285275981: <PipSqueek> 
1285276013: <STLchan> i think we're current to 4 or 5
1285276013: <PipSqueek> 
1285276054: <STLchan> i remember he lost his team and did reality contest to select a new one.  got through that.  i think one season with the new team after the selection
1285276054: <PipSqueek> 
1285276094: <acr0nym> I think that was season 5.
1285276094: <PipSqueek> 
1285276106: <acr0nym> Season 6 is "time in the Loony Bin" and then, out of it.
1285276106: <PipSqueek> 
1285276106: <acr0nym> Heh.
1285276106: <PipSqueek> 
1285276154: <STLchan> house got committed?

1285613248: <PipSqueek> 
1285613268: <tinfoil_> As long as it's in place by Q4, we're good - I added the rule and it was working as of Friday

1285613271: <hoamchan> you want to get the auditors involved - do a simple "elements" report

1285613286: <tinfoil_> Yah
1285613286: <PipSqueek>

1285613288: <PipSqueek> 
1285613303: <hoamchan> usually you can eyeball /etc stuff and see what you want added/is missing
1285613303: <PipSqueek>

1285711260: <ouiji> I like the question.. "Should the US be able to stop other countries we don't "trust" from getting weapons?".. Mainly because it is impossible for me to answer correctly/truthfully. Because well.. it depends on what kind of weapons they are.. if they are buying a bunch of handguns to wipe eachother out.. I say we should give em to them ourselves. now if they are talking about cuba getting nukes.. then yes.. the us should be able too. And well.. also.. were

1285777899: <PipSqueek> 
1285778343: <TeleCon> Could probably sell the N1 for close to what the G2 costs.
1285778343: <PipSqueek>

1285778356: <PipSqueek>

1285778394: <PipSqueek>

1285778403: <PipSqueek>

1285778507: <PipSqueek> 
1285778515: <acr0nym> What are the supposed advantages of the G2?
1285778515: <PipSqueek> 
1285778531: <TeleCon> Diferent chipset, allegedly faster than N1
1285778531: <PipSqueek> 
1285778548: <TeleCon> hspda+, so "4g" speeds.
1285778548: <PipSqueek> 
1285778550: <TeleCon> Keyboard.
1285778550: <PipSqueek> 
1285778559: <TeleCon> About the same thickness as n1.
1285778559: <PipSqueek> 
1285778570: <acr0nym> I thought the N1 had hspda+....
1285778570: <PipSqueek> 
1285778608: <TeleCon> I don't know for sure.

1286212934: <TeleCon> The g2 is essentially an n1 with a keyboard.
1286212934: <PipSqueek> 
1286212936: <]3d0g> what makes you think the iPhone camera is good? I've been underwhelmed at the pics taken with it, TBH.
1286212936: <PipSqueek> 
1286212940: <TeleCon> I'm very happy with it so far.
1286212940: <PipSqueek> 
1286212945: <TeleCon> ]3d0g: Pre order?
1286212945: <PipSqueek> 
1286212952: <TeleCon> The stores are already selling it.
1286212952: <PipSqueek> 
1286212954: <]3d0g> Corp account
1286212954: <PipSqueek> 
1286212960: <TeleCon> Oh yeah.
1286212960: <PipSqueek> 
1286212964: <TeleCon> forgot. I knew that.
1286212964: <PipSqueek> 
1286212966: <TeleCon> :/
1286212966: <tinfoil_> The quality of pictures I took with my iPhone v1 were by far better than my Droid
1286212966: <PipSqueek> 
1286212966: <PipSqueek> 
1286212989: <TeleCon> I'll be refusing delivery of the pre-ordered one.
1286212989: <PipSqueek> 
1286212998: <]3d0g> The Galaxy pics put iPhone to shame in the side-by-sides I've seen.
1286212998: <PipSqueek> 
1286213001: <hoamchan> that's your droid camera, not all android cameras then
1286213001: <PipSqueek> 
1286213024: <tinfoil_> True, but then all the pictures I've seen on other androids might be the person using the camera too
1286213024: <PipSqueek> 
1286213029: <]3d0g> so you already got your g2 telecon?
1286213029: <PipSqueek> 
1286213038: <TeleCon> Yeah
1286213038: <PipSqueek> 
1286213057: <TeleCon> It is a little thicker than an N1, but much sleeker than a G
1286213057: <PipSqueek> 
1286213058: <TeleCon> 1
1286213058: <PipSqueek> 
1286213059: <]3d0g> HSPA+ is supposedly on. Does it show as such?
1286213059: <PipSqueek> 
1286213074: <TeleCon> It's hard to say.
1286213074: <PipSqueek> 
1286213084: <hoamchan> is it raw android or crapped up sense?
1286213084: <PipSqueek> 
1286213098: <]3d0g> Ah, I wondered if it gave a visual indication of "+"
1286213098: <PipSqueek> 
1286213104: <TeleCon> the indicator light shows up as H, instead of 3G, but speeds aren't quite what I hoped for.
1286213104: <PipSqueek> 
1286213121: <TeleCon> hoamchan: Raw, but with some features turned off.
1286213121: <PipSqueek> 
1286213122: <]3d0g> huh
1286213122: <PipSqueek> 
1286213128: <tinfoil_> G2 is only 800Mhz?
1286213128: <PipSqueek> 
1286213131: <tinfoil_> heh
1286213131: <PipSqueek> 
1286213137: <hoamchan> i'm sure they'll have cyanogen for it
1286213137: <PipSqueek> 
1286213141: <TeleCon> Diferent chipset.  Snappier than N1.
1286213141: <PipSqueek> 
1286213149: <]3d0g> different proc tinfoil. it smokes the N1.
1286213149: <tinfoil_> Nice
1286213149: <PipSqueek> 
1286213149: <PipSqueek> 
1286213184: <tinfoil_> Good to know
1286213184: <PipSqueek> 
1286213205: <TeleCon> It doesn't feel toylike as the Vibrant did, plus gps actually works.
1286213205: <PipSqueek> 
1286213210: <]3d0g> Looks like you're going to be seeing a lot of 800MHz phones.
1286213210: <PipSqueek> 
1286213232: <hoamchan> wow.  i get more spam regarding cable TV than viagra now
1286213232: <acr0nym> TeleCon: You trying to sell the N1?
1286213232: <PipSqueek> 
1286213232: <PipSqueek> 
1286213251: <TeleCon> Haven't decided yet.
1286213251: <PipSqueek> 
1286213254: <TeleCon> I may
1286213254: <PipSqueek> 
1286213264: <TeleCon> I may end up giving them to the twins as PMP's
1286213264: <PipSqueek> 
1286213277: <acr0nym> Heh.
1286213277: <PipSqueek> 
1286213313: <TeleCon> But, since I have 2, I should be able to recover the cost of the G2, if I go that route.
1286213313: <PipSqueek> 
1286213384: <hoamchan> i don't think i'd ever consider another motorola device though
1286213384: <PipSqueek> 
1286213436: <TeleCon> The MyTouch HD has already been announced, too.
1286213436: <PipSqueek> 
1286213445: <]3d0g> Anyone looking for a good read, Paolo Bacigalupi's The Windup Girl is positively outstanding. Elements of Neuromancer and Blade Runner wrapped around a very suspenseful story. Nebula and Hugo award winner.
1286213445: <PipSqueek> 
1286213457: <TeleCon> ebook?
1286213457: <acr0nym> I agree....  You didn't buy it, did you?
1286213457: <PipSqueek> 
1286213457: <PipSqueek> 
1286213458: <acr0nym> ;)
1286213458: <PipSqueek> 
1286213463: <acr0nym> TeleCon: I have it in good PDF.
1286213463: <PipSqueek> 
1286213469: <TeleCon> K
1286213469: <PipSqueek> 
1286213476: <]3d0g> EPUB on my kobo.
1286213476: <PipSqueek> 
1286213478: <acr0nym> It showed up for free when IO9 made it "book club" status.
1286213478: <PipSqueek> 
1286213488: <TeleCon> Nice.
1286213488: <hoamchan> i just got a $10 amazon gift card for telling continental and chase how much their new card design sucks
1286213488: <PipSqueek> 
1286213488: <PipSqueek> 
1286213505: <TeleCon> My nook has cosmetic damage now.
1286213505: <PipSqueek> 
1286213511: <hoamchan> drop?
1286213511: <PipSqueek> 
1286213511: <acr0nym> whappened?
1286213512: <PipSqueek> 
1286213518: <TeleCon> Plastic over next page cracked.
1286213518: <PipSqueek> 
1286213520: <TeleCon> Just usage.
1286213520: <PipSqueek> 
1286213529: <tinfoil_> ick
1286213529: <PipSqueek> 
1286213530: <tinfoil_> suck
1286213530: <PipSqueek> 
1286213533: <TeleCon> Yeah
1286213533: <PipSqueek> 
1286213535: <acr0nym> Paint on some cyanoacrylate.  Heh.
1286213535: <PipSqueek> 
1286213536: <tinfoil_> How do you like the nook so far?
1286213536: <PipSqueek> 
1286213540: <TeleCon> I like it.
1286213540: <PipSqueek> 
1286213565: <TeleCon> I still need to root it, and see if I can install the kindle app.
1286213565: <PipSqueek> 
1286213572: <tinfoil_> Bleh, hate waiting on customs
1286213572: <PipSqueek> 
1286213577: <TeleCon> See if works with the ink display
1286213577: <PipSqueek> 
1286213583: <]3d0g> new kobo with wifi comes out in Nov. I'll probably pick it up so I can start hacking on this one.
1286213583: <PipSqueek> 
1286213625: <hoamchan> i wonder how long until book portability becomes a hot topic issue in the legislature :P
1286213625: <PipSqueek> 
1286213626: <tinfoil_> Woo, my package from China left customs.  now if only my shipment from canada would do the same
1286213626: <PipSqueek> 
1286213755: <tinfoil_> When I was in the Navy I carried my Applied Cryptography book with me every time I flew in and out of Japan
1286213755: <PipSqueek> 
1286213760: <tinfoil_> To the US
1286213760: <PipSqueek> 
1286213766: <tinfoil_> At the time, it was a criminal act
1286213766: <PipSqueek> 
1286213767: <tinfoil_> :-)
1286213767: <PipSqueek> 
1286214056: <TeleCon> You bastard@
1286214056: <PipSqueek> 
1286214063: <TeleCon> You killed kenny, too, didn't you.
1286214063: <PipSqueek> 
1286214075: <tinfoil_> Didn't we all?
1286214075: <PipSqueek> 
1286214327: <TeleCon> yeah
1286214327: <PipSqueek> 
1286214412: <]3d0g> I bet you wore your DeCSS shirt through the security checkpoints too, you rebel.
1286214412: <PipSqueek> 
1286214428: <tinfoil_> DeCSS didn't exist at the time.
1286214428: <PipSqueek> 
1286214439: <tinfoil_> Else I would have :-)
1286214439: <PipSqueek> 
1286214487: <tinfoil_> this was like 94, encryption was still treated as weaponry according to the law.
1286214487: <PipSqueek> 
1286214521: <TeleCon> I had an RSA in perl and barcode shirt.
1286214521: <PipSqueek> 
1286214537: <tinfoil_> Ohhhh
1286214537: <PipSqueek> 
1286214546: <tinfoil_> Ohh, not weaponry, munition
1286214546: <PipSqueek> 
1286215191: <tinfoil_> Heh, TEMPEST sheilding is still technically illegal
1286215191: <PipSqueek> 
1286215200: <TeleCon> What?
1286215200: <PipSqueek> 
1286215211: <tinfoil_> to import/export at least
1286215211: <PipSqueek> 
1286215232: <tinfoil_> RFI/EMI shielding
1286215232: <PipSqueek> 
1286215245: <tinfoil_> especially tempest certified shielding
1286215245: <PipSqueek> 
1286215260: <tinfoil_> You have to be licensed to export it
1286215260: <PipSqueek>

1286222341: <PipSqueek> 
1286224671: <TeleCon> nice
1286224671: <PipSqueek> 
1286224674: <TeleCon> I'll take one.
1286224674: <PipSqueek> 
1286224747: <tinfoil_> Just think - mix that with a robot and a camera.
1286224747: <PipSqueek> 
1286224791: <tinfoil_> And more
1286224791: <PipSqueek> 
1286224796: <tinfoil_> That's scary

1286224947: <PipSqueek> 
1286225474: <]3d0g> finally got an order through though
1286225474: <PipSqueek> 
1286225513: --- acr0nym has changed the topic to: "Humanity is acquiring all the right technology for all the wrong reasons." -- R. Buckminster Fuller
1286225531: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: Yeah, it was running SLOW.  Had to have been a "hackaday" effect.
1286225531: <PipSqueek> 
1286225640: <]3d0g> naw, even on a good day it sucks. took me several tries to get an order for some TI proto boards a month ago. Their order system keeps claiming you're a "bot" and cancels the order.
1286225640: <PipSqueek> 
1286225690: <tinfoil_> It's okay, the end user is their smallest customer.  
1286225690: <PipSqueek> 
1286225692: <tinfoil_> :-)
1286225692: <PipSqueek> 
1286225756: <]3d0g> is weird how they're courting the hobbyist community lately.

1286225879: <PipSqueek> 
1286225880: <tinfoil_> ?
1286225880: <PipSqueek> 
1286226234: <dp> well, on our box, load went from 50-60 (on a dual dual-core box) to 1-3
1286226234: <PipSqueek> 
1286226244: <tinfoil_> Nice!
1286226244: <PipSqueek> 
1286226250: <tinfoil_> How about CPU usage?
1286226250: <PipSqueek> 
1286226260: <dp> about the same, really
1286226260: <PipSqueek> 
1286226265: <dp> memory usage is about the same too
1286226265: <PipSqueek> 
1286226277: <tinfoil_> Thats what I was expecting
1286226277: <PipSqueek> 
1286226283: <tinfoil_> less threads, though, right?
1286226283: <PipSqueek> 
1286226293: <tinfoil_> or processes
1286226293: <PipSqueek> 
1286226434: <dp> processes
1286226434: <PipSqueek> 
1286226440: <dp> it was processbased
1286226440: <PipSqueek> 
1286226447: <dp> so we'd have 100+  processes running
1286226447: <PipSqueek> 
1286226451: <dp> now, it's thread-based
1286226451: <PipSqueek> 
1286226454: <dp> we have 5 processes
1286226454: <PipSqueek> 
1286226460: <dp> with several hundred threads
1286226460: <PipSqueek> 
1286226497: <tinfoil_> nice!
1286226497: <PipSqueek> 
1286226527: <dp> our sites weren't even serving
1286226527: <PipSqueek> 
1286226531: <dp> now they're nice and snappy
1286226531: <PipSqueek> 
1286226539: <dp> still got some other things to tweak
1286226539: <PipSqueek> 
1286226547: <dp> but, it's nice to have that weight offa my shoulders
1286226547: <PipSqueek> 
1286226573: <tinfoil_> Gonna offload static content to a seperate process?
1286226573: <PipSqueek> 
1286226588: <dp> static content is cached via nginx on a seperate box
1286226588: <PipSqueek> 
1286226598: <tinfoil_> already done... check
1286226598: <PipSqueek> 
1286226600: <tinfoil_> :-)
1286226600: <PipSqueek> 
1286226609: <dp> loaded up through apache, but then served primarily through  nginx
1286226609: <PipSqueek> 
1286226633: <tinfoil_> as in a caching reverse proxy?
1286226633: <PipSqueek> 
1286226638: <dp> yeah
1286226638: <PipSqueek> 
1286226642: <tinfoil_> nice
1286226642: <PipSqueek> 
1286226651: <tinfoil_> Does it help?
1286226651: <PipSqueek> 
1286226652: <dp> it also handles compression of JS/css
1286226652: <PipSqueek> 
1286226657: <dp> yes
1286226657: <PipSqueek> 
1286226658: <dp> it does
1286226658: <PipSqueek> 
1286226667: <dp> it better handles 304's than apache
1286226667: <PipSqueek> 
1286226697: <tinfoil_> Oh
1286226697: <tinfoil_> nice
1286226697: <PipSqueek> 
1286226697: <PipSqueek> 
1286226734: <dp> bbl.  going to make some more changes
1286226734: <PipSqueek> 
1286227246: <tinfoil_> Nice!  Computrace caught a user who brought a laptop home and re-installed it with Win7
1286227246: <PipSqueek> 
1286227252: <tinfoil_> so we locked the laptop
1286227252: <PipSqueek> 
1286227263: <tinfoil_> Wonder if that'll scare him :-)
1286227263: <PipSqueek> 
1286227379: <tinfoil_> The real test, however, is that a laptop was stolen out of a car.  Versus freezing the laptop, we report it to computrace as stolen.  They turn on GPS tracking.  If the laptop is re-installed the moment it pops on the internet it'll call home
1286227379: <PipSqueek> 
1286227397: <tinfoil_> If it's not re-installed it will do the same if they get past PGP full disk encryption
1286227397: <PipSqueek> 
1286228065: <hoamchan> yes but that doesn't tell me when the lyndhurst/rutherford tower goes live
1286228065: <PipSqueek> 
1286228352: <TeleCon> tinfoil_: What about a complete wipe and installing linux?
1286228352: <PipSqueek> 
1286228825: <acr0nym> computrace is BIOS-based, right?
1286228825: <PipSqueek> 
1286228848: <tinfoil_> Yeah, but it can only auto-reinstall on Win
1286228848: <PipSqueek> 
1286228855: <acr0nym> Ah.
1286228855: <PipSqueek> 
1286228905: <tinfoil_> If we lock a machine it's locked out at the BIOS level and HDD -- move the HDD to another machine, it's still locked, you need to replace the drive's controller board to access it.  Then you need to bypass PGP full disk encryption.
1286228905: <PipSqueek> 
1286229053: <tinfoil_> It's pretty cool
1286229053: <PipSqueek> 
1286229094: <tinfoil_> The reason why we try not to lock stolen machines is because they have an 80% recovery rate on stolen laptops
1286229094: <PipSqueek> 
1286229100: <tinfoil_> with criminal prosicution
1286229100: <PipSqueek> 
1286229142: <tinfoil_> I'm assuming those other 20% are either by people who are too dumb to re-install/pawn or by people who are smart enough to install linux
1286229142: <PipSqueek> 
1286229465: <tinfoil_> Gotta love this.  Management set forth the policy that a new team was to manage all AD accounts from now on.
1286229465: <PipSqueek> 
1286229482: <tinfoil_> Everyone else's permissions were taken away
1286229482: <PipSqueek> 
1286229505: <tinfoil_> The thing is, they never received training on managing Linux accounts in AD
1286229505: <PipSqueek> 
1286229546: <tinfoil_> I've bounced about 30 tickets to them today.  Normally I get about 7-10 tickets a week
1286229546: <PipSqueek> 
1286229559: <tinfoil_> so they've screwed up that many times in less than one business day.
1286229559: <PipSqueek> 
1286234672: <tinfoil_> Email to management to train them falls on deaf ears.
1286234672: <PipSqueek> 
1286234698: <tinfoil_> Really, I'll train them....
1286234698: <PipSqueek> 
1286234727: <tinfoil_> The manager in charge of the group seems to have an attitude that it's not any different than managing a normal AD account.  :-\
1286234727: <PipSqueek> 
1286234791: <tinfoil_> Wonder if I'll have an email about training, or getting my ass chewed by tomorrow. (ass chewed for not training them before they took over, even though the first I heard about it was today)

1286294828: <ouiji> yea?*
1286294828: <PipSqueek> 
1286294935: <TeleCon> Yep
1286294935: <PipSqueek> 
1286294985: <ouiji> good stuff
1286294985: <PipSqueek> 
1286294990: <ouiji> least something does

1286295175: * ]3d0g Has: No tea. Pocket fluff.
1286295220: <]3d0g> Oh, and a thing my aunt gave you which I don't know what it is 
1286295220: <PipSqueek> 
1286295249: <TeleCon> A bowl of petunias thinking Oh no, not again?
1286295249: <PipSqueek> 
1286295254: <acr0nym> Heh, you really should have come north for "Jet Lamp".
1286295254: <PipSqueek> 
1286295274: <]3d0g> oh, that movie premier?
1286295274: <PipSqueek> 
1286295279: <acr0nym> Showing.
1286295279: <PipSqueek> 
1286295281: <]3d0g> I really should have.
1286295281: <PipSqueek> 
1286295285: <]3d0g> curse my slack.
1286295285: <PipSqueek> 
1286295288: <acr0nym> Heh.
1286295288: <PipSqueek> 
1286295299: <acr0nym> I can make the DVD images available to you, though.
1286295299: <PipSqueek> 
1286295304: <acr0nym> I'm pretty sure it's CC licensed.
1286295304: <PipSqueek> 
1286295306: <TeleCon> As can I.

1286295758: <]3d0g> Coffee is the ying to my yang.
1286295758: <PipSqueek> 
1286295883: <TeleCon> Yeah, a morning without coffee is a lot like sleep.
1286295883: <PipSqueek> 
1286296177: <]3d0g> Fucking TMO won't ship my G2 until the "release" date - tomorrow.
1286296177: <PipSqueek> 
1286296755: <TeleCon> Suck
1286296755: <PipSqueek> 
1286297755: <tinfoil_> Simple solution to that is to break your addiction to coffee.  :-)
1286297755: <PipSqueek> 
1286297975: <]3d0g> Where's my scepter? A demon of stupidity is in the #.
1286297975: <PipSqueek> 
1286298035: <tinfoil_> I think I just had a near Rincewind experience.
1286298035: <PipSqueek> 
1286298060: <TeleCon> tinfoil_: I'd kill someone becaues of the headaches.
1286298060: <PipSqueek> 
1286298220: <tinfoil_> TeleCon: The headaches go away after a week, the fatigue after 2 weeks
1286298220: <PipSqueek> 
1286298240: <tinfoil_> When I quit though, I was sleeping VERY heavy for nearly a month after. 
1286298240: <PipSqueek> 
1286298265: <tinfoil_> I still drink now, but no more than 1 cup a day, and always in the morning
1286298265: <PipSqueek> 
1286298276: <tinfoil_> if I don't drink it by 12, I won't drink it
1286298276: <PipSqueek> 
1286298764: <tinfoil_> Funny thing is, I did all that to help my sleep issues.  It helped a lot.
1286298764: <PipSqueek> 
1286298817: <dp> ok
1286298817: <PipSqueek> 
1286298821: <dp> I'm terribly confused
1286298821: <PipSqueek> 
1286298825: <dp> we have 2 apache servers
1286298825: <PipSqueek> 
1286298837: <dp> 1 is a single-proc dual core with 3G of RAM
1286298837: <PipSqueek> 
1286298862: <dp> the other is either (a single-proc dual core, or a dual-proc single core) with 2G of RAM
1286298862: <PipSqueek> 
1286298870: <dp> guess which one is handling the apache load better?
1286298870: <PipSqueek> 
1286298907: <tinfoil_> the one with less multithreading overhead?
1286298907: <PipSqueek> 
1286298926: <tinfoil_> Higher load average, but higher CPU?
1286298926: <PipSqueek> 
1286298933: <tinfoil_> err
1286298933: <PipSqueek> 
1286298936: <dp> higher CPU?
1286298936: <PipSqueek> 
1286298953: <tinfoil_> Higher load average on the dual, but higher CPU on the single?
1286298953: <PipSqueek> 
1286298962: <dp> oh, box 1 is a 3GHz, and box 2 is a 2.*GHz
1286298962: <PipSqueek> 
1286298964: <dp> 2.8
1286298964: <PipSqueek> 
1286298967: <tinfoil_> Ohhhh
1286298967: <PipSqueek> 
1286298980: <dp> I'm so terribly confused
1286298980: <PipSqueek> 
1286298986: <tinfoil_> Me too
1286298986: <PipSqueek> 
1286298991: <dp> my theory would be that the bigger box would be faster
1286298991: <PipSqueek> 
1286298993: <dp> but it's not
1286298993: <PipSqueek> 
1286299001: <tinfoil_> What is the IO on the box?
1286299001: <PipSqueek> 
1286299003: <tinfoil_> both of them?
1286299003: <PipSqueek> 
1286299004: <dp> the only other difference is Debian vs Gentoo
1286299004: <PipSqueek> 
1286299013: <tinfoil_> Which is which?
1286299013: <PipSqueek> 
1286299015: <dp> tinfoil_: meaning?
1286299015: <PipSqueek> 
1286299024: <dp> tinfoil_: Box 1 is Gentoo.  Box 2 is Debian
1286299024: <PipSqueek> 
1286299036: <tinfoil_> What kind of HDD controllers, HD's, channel memory
1286299036: <PipSqueek> 
1286299054: <tinfoil_> There are a lot of factors involved with performance, sadly
1286299054: <PipSqueek> 
1286299055: <dp> both SATA or SCSI drives
1286299055: <PipSqueek> 
1286299072: <dp> I'd have to do some digging to determine
1286299072: <PipSqueek> 
1286299073: <tinfoil_> also, which generation of CPU (newer lower Mhz ones are better than older higher Mhz ones)
1286299073: <PipSqueek> 
1286299099: <dp> dunno.  Both Xeons
1286299099: <PipSqueek> 
1286299105: <tinfoil_> Also, it depends on how the gentoo box was built.  :-)
1286299105: <PipSqueek> 
1286299119: <dp> Box 1 is a 3.00 model 6 stepping 4 with 2M of L2 cache
1286299119: <PipSqueek> 
1286299134: <dp> Box 2 is a 2.80 model 4 stepping 1 with 1M of L2 cache
1286299134: <PipSqueek> 
1286299157: <tinfoil_> I'd check CPU version, L1/L3/(and L3 if availble) cache size, how many channels of memory per box, specific info on HDD's (controllers, drive speeds)
1286299157: <PipSqueek> 
1286299171: <tinfoil_> interesting
1286299171: <PipSqueek> 
1286299172: <dp> tell me where I can get it, and I'll check it ;)
1286299172: <PipSqueek> 
1286299181: <tinfoil_> I used to know, but now I don't
1286299181: <PipSqueek> 
1286299187: <dp> brb, gotta debug another issue
1286299187: <PipSqueek> 
1286299200: <tinfoil_> It's very likely how gentoo was built
1286299200: <PipSqueek> 
1286299210: <dp> possibly.  I wasn't involved in that
1286299210: <PipSqueek> 
1286299220: <dp> I'm not particularly a fan of gentoo
1286299220: <PipSqueek> 
1286299234: <tinfoil_> I am, but only in specific cases any more
1286299234: <PipSqueek> 
1286299261: <tinfoil_> mainly if you run a dedicated cluster
1286299261: <PipSqueek> 
1286299271: <tinfoil_> then you can optimize gentoo to the cluster's needs and make it very specific
1286299271: <PipSqueek> 
1286299284: <tinfoil_> Else, it's too overengineered
1286299284: <PipSqueek> 
1286299381: <tinfoil_> Gentoo did do something the other distros didn't - improved the documentation for a lot of technical aspects of linux.  
1286299381: <PipSqueek> 
1286299780: <tinfoil_> Hrm
1286299780: <PipSqueek> 
1286299798: <tinfoil_> No good discworld quote sites - at least for death
1286299798: <PipSqueek> 
1286299808: <tinfoil_> Not on my first 2 pages of google at least
1286299808: <PipSqueek> 
1286299935: <tinfoil_> oh, on wikiquote, just not attributed
1286299935: <PipSqueek> 
1286299946: <tinfoil_> Gotta look for smallcaps
1286299946: <PipSqueek> 
1286300326: <TeleCon> acr0nym and ]3d0g: What kind of speeds do you get if you run speed test right now?\
1286300326: <PipSqueek> 
1286300425: <]3d0g> on TMO, I assume?
1286300425: <PipSqueek> 
1286300429: <TeleCon> Yeah
1286300429: <PipSqueek> 
1286300445: <]3d0g> well, shit because there's no 3G inside this building :)
1286300445: <PipSqueek> 
1286300450: <TeleCon> Ah
1286300450: <PipSqueek> 
1286300457: <TeleCon> What about outside?
1286300457: <PipSqueek> 
1286300491: <]3d0g> That would require me going outside where that big evil glowy thing's in the sky.
1286300491: <PipSqueek> 
1286300507: <TeleCon> Um.
1286300507: <PipSqueek> 
1286300514: <TeleCon> Historical tests would work.
1286300514: <PipSqueek> 
1286300578: <acr0nym> Which speedtest?
1286300578: <PipSqueek> 
1286300593: <TeleCon> The fcc or ookla speed test.
1286300593: <PipSqueek> 
1286300605: <acr0nym> Uh...  I'm gonna need more info...
1286300605: <PipSqueek> 
1286300621: <tinfoil_> How about a url?
1286300621: <PipSqueek> 
1286300624: <TeleCon> search on "speedtest" in market.
1286300624: <PipSqueek>

1286309547: <hoamchan> hah.  i have wpa2 set for the clear spot and the n1.  will only share with the elderly and hot chix 
1286309547: <PipSqueek> 
1286309592: <hoamchan> felt bad for some geezers trying to upload their photos at st louis/lambert
1286309592: <PipSqueek> 
1286309766: <]3d0g> telecon: 560kbps up, 130 down. 3G. BUT, the G2 just arrived...
1286309766: <PipSqueek> 
1286309861: <tinfoil_> Wow, morale just tanked here.
1286309861: <PipSqueek> 
1286309868: <acr0nym> Why, what happened?
1286309869: <PipSqueek> 
1286309906: <tinfoil_> Mixture of things
1286309906: <PipSqueek> 
1286309925: <tinfoil_> they just let go of someone we all love
1286309925: <PipSqueek> 
1286310219: <acr0nym> Ah, suck.
1286310219: <PipSqueek> 
1286310300: <]3d0g> man, this phone is nice already.
1286310300: <PipSqueek> 
1286310314: <TeleCon> ]3d0g: I like mine.
1286310314: <PipSqueek> 
1286310334: <TeleCon> tinfoil_: Suckage
1286310334: <PipSqueek> 
1286310438: <TeleCon> Seems like hspa+ should be faster.
1286310438: <PipSqueek> 
1286310472: <]3d0g> still only getting Edge in the building. I'll need to brave the glowing orb again...
1286310472: <PipSqueek> 
1286310504: <tinfoil_> Fear not, the glowing orb will disappear soon
1286310504: <PipSqueek> 
1286310520: <tinfoil_> And if you fear it that much, move to Nome Alaska
1286310520: <PipSqueek> 
1286310533: <]3d0g> fits the old g1 case perfectly. :)
1286310533: <PipSqueek> 
1286310551: <]3d0g> I feat Gnomes even more.
1286310551: <PipSqueek> 
1286310553: <]3d0g> feaer
1286310553: <PipSqueek> 
1286310555: <]3d0g> fear
1286310555: <PipSqueek> 
1286310557: <]3d0g> fuck
1286310557: <PipSqueek> 
1286310570: <tinfoil_> You fuck Gnomes even more?
1286310571: <PipSqueek> 
1286310606: <]3d0g> only the hot jailbait ones.
1286310606: <PipSqueek> 
1286310611: <tinfoil_> heheh
1286310611: <PipSqueek> 
1286310641: <tinfoil_> I had a photoshoot idea involving gnomes
1286310641: <PipSqueek> 
1286310933: <fbx> wow...unexpected turn there
1286310933: <PipSqueek> 
1286310948: <tinfoil_> Was also told that the boss who's leaving was told by the director (my old boss) that he needs to give up his hobbies
1286310948: <PipSqueek> 
1286310950: <tinfoil_> quit his band
1286310950: <PipSqueek> 
1286310951: <tinfoil_> etc
1286310951: <PipSqueek> 
1286310959: <tinfoil_> any surprise he's leaving?
1286310959: <PipSqueek> 
1286310975: <TeleCon> Whoa
1286310975: <PipSqueek> 
1286311115: <acr0nym> tinfoil_: Is it possible that you just have some bizarre and uncanny ability to find the worst jobs on the planet?
1286311115: <PipSqueek> 
1286311119: <acr0nym> Heh.
1286311119: <PipSqueek> 
1286311124: <tinfoil_> It's not that bad for me
1286311124: <PipSqueek> 
1286311125: <tinfoil_> honestly
1286311125: <PipSqueek> 
1286311155: <tinfoil_> I get told to work 70 hour weeks, I don't complain, and also don't change my hours
1286311155: <PipSqueek> 
1286311161: <tinfoil_> nobody says anything
1286311161: <PipSqueek> 
1286311179: <tinfoil_> If they let me go, there is no history yet that I've been a poor performer
1286311179: <PipSqueek> 
1286311186: <tinfoil_> so screw it
1286311186: <PipSqueek> 
1286311198: <tinfoil_> I'll do my job to the best of my ability in about 50 hours a week
1286311198: <PipSqueek> 
1286311390: <tinfoil_> blahahah... team asks me to check a server to ensure it's ready for production
1286311390: <PipSqueek> 
1286311417: <tinfoil_> SSH - times out.  RDP - times out.  ping - times out
1286311417: <PipSqueek> 
1286311434: <tinfoil_> I think I'm going to send a vague message to them "I don't believe this server is ready for production."
1286311434: <PipSqueek> 
1286311444: <dp> ;)
1286311444: <PipSqueek> 
1286311446: <tinfoil_> Just to see what the reply is
1286311446: <PipSqueek> 
1286311914: <TeleCon> lol
1286311914: <PipSqueek> 
1286312617: <tinfoil_> You see google's new image format?
1286312617: <PipSqueek> 
1286312648: <tinfoil_> Opinions?
1286312648: <PipSqueek> 
1286312677: <TeleCon> haven't seen it.
1286312677: <PipSqueek> 
1286312762: <acr0nym> Heh, you mean image search format?
1286312762: <PipSqueek> 
1286312992: <tinfoil_> Oh, it's all over the photography twits and blogs
1286312992: <PipSqueek> 
1286312995: <tinfoil_> new image format
1286312995: <PipSqueek> 
1286313005: <tinfoil_> lossy, same image quality as jpg, but 40% smaller
1286313005: <PipSqueek> 
1286313117: <tinfoil_> open sores too
1286313117: <PipSqueek> 
1286313162: <tinfoil_> Google is also pushing WebM, their open sores video format.  With youTube and Chrome under their control it'll likely catch on
1286313162: <PipSqueek> 
1286313164: <acr0nym> OH, ah. Hrm.
1286313164: <PipSqueek> 
1286313594: <tinfoil_> Yeah, if you think about it nothing really caught on after JPG
1286313594: <PipSqueek> 
1286313618: <tinfoil_> there have been formats that followed, but nothing that was distinct enough to catch on
1286313618: <PipSqueek> 
1286313645: <tinfoil_> 40% size reduction at the same quality is a huge difference for image heavy sites
1286313645: <PipSqueek> 
1286313803: <TeleCon> Holy fuck! (pricing camera lenses)
1286313803: <PipSqueek> 
1286313815: <tinfoil_> Yeah
1286313815: <PipSqueek> 
1286313823: <tinfoil_> What you looking for, I might be able to guide you
1286313823: <PipSqueek> 
1286313833: <tinfoil_> or offer suggestions :-)
1286313833: <PipSqueek> 
1286313844: <TeleCon> fast nikon lenses.
1286313844: <PipSqueek> 
1286313857: <tinfoil_> oh yeah check out lensrentals.com too
1286313857: <PipSqueek> 
1286313888: <tinfoil_> I'm very happy with my high end sigma glass.  The lowend stuff has quality issues.  Using a 50mm f/1.4 and a 30mm f/1.4 
1286313888: <PipSqueek> 
1286313903: <tinfoil_> I highly recommend renting before you buy
1286313903: <PipSqueek> 
1286313920: <tinfoil_> Very cool lens means shit if it doesn't match your style and needs
1286313920: <PipSqueek> 
1286313940: <TeleCon> It's a present.
1286313940: <PipSqueek> 
1286313947: <tinfoil_> Oh
1286313947: <PipSqueek> 
1286313962: <tinfoil_> What kind of work does the person do?
1286313962: <PipSqueek> 
1286313974: <TeleCon> Mostly youth portraits.
1286313974: <PipSqueek> 
1286314010: <tinfoil_> What do they currently have?
1286314010: <PipSqueek> 
1286314022: <TeleCon> Ummm
1286314022: <PipSqueek> 
1286314036: <TeleCon> A f3.5-4.5 zoom, iirc
1286314036: <PipSqueek> 
1286314067: <tinfoil_> the lens that came with the camera?
1286314067: <PipSqueek> 
1286314072: <TeleCon> yeah
1286314072: <PipSqueek> 
1286314080: <tinfoil_> What camera model? 
1286314080: <PipSqueek> 
1286314082: <dp> ugh
1286314082: <PipSqueek> 
1286314086: <TeleCon> d3k
1286314086: <PipSqueek> 
1286314087: <dp> this week has been *hell*
1286314087: <PipSqueek> 
1286314145: <tinfoil_> D3.... really?   That's the uber high end model?
1286314145: <PipSqueek> 
1286314155: <TeleCon> d3000 and no.
1286314155: <PipSqueek> 
1286314163: <tinfoil_> ohhhh D3000
1286314163: <PipSqueek> 
1286314173: <tinfoil_> yeah, zeros matter :-)
1286314173: <PipSqueek> 
1286314179: <TeleCon> hence the k
1286314179: <PipSqueek> 
1286314181: <tinfoil_> dp:  sounds like you've been making progress though
1286314181: <PipSqueek> 
1286314193: <TeleCon> k is easier to type than 000
1286314193: <PipSqueek> 
1286314216: <tinfoil_> yeah, but is confusing when they have d3 model with letter sub models
1286314216: <PipSqueek> 
1286314226: <TeleCon> I didn't know that.
1286314226: <PipSqueek> 
1286314253: <tinfoil_> TeleCon: Ok, what you told me helps
1286314253: <PipSqueek> 
1286314264: <tinfoil_> It's a crop sensor (smaller than full-frame)
1286314264: <PipSqueek> 
1286314272: <tinfoil_> that means you can go for cheaper fast lenses
1286314272: <PipSqueek> 
1286314273: <TeleCon> Yeah
1286314273: <PipSqueek> 
1286314278: <tinfoil_> that are designed for crop sensor
1286314278: <PipSqueek> 
1286314295: <tinfoil_> the issue is that the lens won't work should they upgrade to a full frame
1286314295: <PipSqueek> 
1286314321: <TeleCon> http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-50mm-Nikkor-Digital-Cameras/dp/B00005LEN4/ref=pd_cp_p_2
1286314321: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/7ley (Amazon.com: Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras: Camera & Photo)
1286314321: <tinfoil_> I'll come up with a list of lenses
1286314321: <PipSqueek> 
1286314332: <TeleCon> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVA0U?ie=UTF8&tag=photo-12-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001GCVA0U
1286314332: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/7lez (Amazon.com: Nikon 50mm f/1.4G SIC SW Prime Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras: Camera & Photo)
1286314332: <TeleCon> Also looks nice and doable.
1286314332: <PipSqueek> 
1286314344: <TeleCon> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JCSV8U?ie=UTF8&tag=photo-12-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002JCSV8U
1286314344: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/7lf1 (Amazon.com: Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II AF-S NIKKOR Lens For Nikon Digital SLR Cameras: Camera & Photo)
1286314347: <TeleCon> A little harder to justify.
1286314347: <PipSqueek> 
1286314447: <tinfoil_> http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ns=p_PRICE_2|0&ci=15492&N=4293919655+4294185277+4294951200+4291220258+4291172234+4294951199+4294951201
1286314447: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/7lf2 (B&H Error)
1286314452: <tinfoil_> Prime lenses will give you more bang for the buck
1286314452: <PipSqueek> 
1286314481: <tinfoil_> I selected good portrait lenses and ordered them in order of price (low to high)
1286314481: <PipSqueek> 
1286314507: <tinfoil_> Those first two lenses are very good - the catch is s/he will have to move around (no zoom)
1286314507: <PipSqueek> 
1286314512: <TeleCon> Yeah
1286314512: <PipSqueek> 
1286314523: <TeleCon> Well, she also does wildlife occasionally, as well.
1286314523: <PipSqueek> 
1286314524: <TeleCon> :)
1286314524: <PipSqueek> 
1286314533: <tinfoil_> Also good to note... crop sensors multiply the zoom by 1.6
1286314533: <PipSqueek> 
1286314544: <TeleCon> I did not know that.
1286314544: <PipSqueek> 
1286314545: <TeleCon> OK
1286314545: <PipSqueek> 
1286314549: <tinfoil_> Yeah
1286314549: <PipSqueek> 
1286314553: <]3d0g> I don't like this uber-mini USB port, but I guess that's they way all phones are going now.
1286314553: <PipSqueek> 
1286314569: <]3d0g> another fucking random cable to keep track of...
1286314569: <PipSqueek> 
1286314596: <tinfoil_> So what is a 50mm in a full-frame camera is an 80mm in a cropped sensor
1286314596: <PipSqueek> 
1286314604: <TeleCon> Yeah, N1, Vibrant, and MyTouch Slide all have micro usb.
1286314604: <PipSqueek> 
1286314608: <TeleCon> As well as g2
1286314608: <PipSqueek> 
1286314612: <TeleCon> tinfoil_: k
1286314612: <PipSqueek> 
1286314654: <tinfoil_> After that, you're on your own
1286314654: <PipSqueek> 
1286314679: <TeleCon> tinfoil_: Still seems like http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-50mm-Nikkor-Digital-Cameras/dp/B00005LEN4/ref=pd_cp_p_2 might be a good choice 
1286314679: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/7ley (Amazon.com: Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras: Camera & Photo)
1286314700: <tinfoil_> Telecon - agreed.  it's very good
1286314700: <PipSqueek> 
1286314725: <tinfoil_> It'll zoom a little slower than the ones I showed you (I did filter out Nikon name brande, notably)
1286314725: <PipSqueek> 
1286314741: <tinfoil_> I like shopping on B&H as well as their reviews, then buying on amazon
1286314741: <PipSqueek> 
1286314943: <tinfoil_> Not zoom
1286314943: <PipSqueek> 
1286314946: <tinfoil_> focus
1286314946: <PipSqueek> 
1286314964: <tinfoil_> Every kit should have a 30 or 50mm (depending on the crop of the sensor)
1286314964: <PipSqueek> 
1286314967: <tinfoil_> IMHO
1286314967: <PipSqueek> 
1286314996: <tinfoil_> My next lenses are a sigma 8-16mm and a 70-200 f/2.8
1286314996: <PipSqueek> 
1286315011: <tinfoil_> Dunno what brand yet on the 70-200
1286315011: <PipSqueek> 
1286315127: <TeleCon> Gotcha
1286315127: <PipSqueek> 
1286315133: <TeleCon> I need a 30mm then.
1286315133: <PipSqueek> 
1286315137: <TeleCon> I have the same camera
1286315137: <PipSqueek>

1286377297: <PipSqueek> 
1286377684: <ouiji> anyone know of a way to "hide" links in something like an image for an email footer? Our new company email footer contains 3 new links and it is triggering spam filters to flag it as spam..  
1286377684: <PipSqueek> 
1286378514: <dp> remove them?
1286378514: <PipSqueek> 
1286378524: <dp> Outlook will strip out most inline CSS anyway
1286378524: <PipSqueek> 
1286378552: <]3d0g> I assume YOU aren't putting in the footer and the server is, no?
1286378552: <PipSqueek> 
1286378935: <]3d0g> 1st G2 disappointment. "Stock" 2.2 isn't.
1286378935: <PipSqueek> 
1286380744: <acr0nym> What's the story?
1286380744: <PipSqueek> 
1286381202: <]3d0g> tether / hotspot disabled.
1286381202: <PipSqueek> 
1286381611: <acr0nym> Ah, fuckers.
1286381611: <PipSqueek> 
1286381758: <]3d0g> It's giving the rooters over on xda fits too. Apparently, the G2 has a special chip that resets /system at boot. So even when you get root, there's no way to make it stick (yet).
1286381758: <PipSqueek> 
1286381809: <acr0nym> Yeah, heard about the "no root" persistency chip.
1286381809: <PipSqueek> 
1286381951: <tinfoil_> Very cool

1286382016: <PipSqueek> 
1286382095: <]3d0g> yeah, I thought that case was impressive
1286382095: <PipSqueek> 
1286382106: <tinfoil_> If you want, I'll walk across the street and smack someone over at T-Mobile for including a root-kit remover
1286382106: <PipSqueek> 
1286382330: <]3d0g> don't think TMO had anything to do with this. It's hardware so HTC is to blame.
1286382330: <PipSqueek> 
1286382344: <tinfoil_> Ohh
1286382344: <PipSqueek> 
1286382345: <tinfoil_> Ok
1286382345: <PipSqueek> 
1286382386: <acr0nym> The question'll be who's responsible for it.
1286382386: <PipSqueek> 
1286382410: <acr0nym> Like, is it in all G2's sold anywhere?
1286382410: <PipSqueek>

1286382422: <hoamchan> CM just got his in the mail
1286382422: <PipSqueek> 
1286382484: <]3d0g> he's definitely ace in custom builds, but I don't think he was ever a significant player in the jailbreaking scene. 
1286382484: <PipSqueek> 
1286382550: <hoamchan> this article appears to be bullshit.  if it was true, XDA would be buzzing with fury
1286382550: <PipSqueek>

1286382978: <PipSqueek> 
1286383034: <]3d0g> no, it's root, not jailbreak. jailbreak is to get a phone working on another system.
1286383034: <PipSqueek> 
1286383058: <]3d0g> and for the G2, the immediate need is to regain our god-given tether abilities. 
1286383058: <PipSqueek> 
1286383089: <fbx> ah...you're right...shouldn't have s/'d
1286383089: <PipSqueek> 
1286383099: <]3d0g> and it has been rooted already. That was easy. problem now is getting it to stick across boots.
1286383099: <PipSqueek> 
1286383115: <fbx> just starting to read the thread above, so i'm behind
1286383115: <PipSqueek> 
1286383207: <]3d0g> If TMO had just left the fucking tethering alone. I was really hoping to be able to stick with stock OS this phone...
1286383207: <PipSqueek> 
1286383244: <fbx> $$$ in denying outright tethering, no?
1286383244: <PipSqueek> 
1286383257: <tinfoil_> "We've emailed your group several times about  creating AD accounts.."   "You sent us several emails asking about creating AD accounts.  We answered your questions."

1286383257: <PipSqueek> 
1286383264: <]3d0g> but they allow it on the N1.
1286383264: <PipSqueek> 
1286383353: <tinfoil_> It's funny when people are up against deadlines.  They ask you how to do something, you tell them in explicate detail, and they turn around asking why you haven't done it yet.

1286383748: <hoamchan> eat it, bitches
1286383748: <PipSqueek> 
1286383756: <tinfoil_> no shit

1286383787: <PipSqueek> 
1286383799: <tinfoil_> They come to us to go into production, so we scan them find a ton of vulnerabilities, they take the report and put the machines into production
1286383799: <PipSqueek> 
1286383842: <hoamchan> that's proper risk acceptance there actually.  had you not scanned them at all, you would have been remiss 
1286383842: <PipSqueek> 
1286383854: <hoamchan> someone took your report and said "i don't give a fuck"
1286383854: <PipSqueek> 
1286383862: <tinfoil_> That's the thing too, they wait until last minute, and say "We're releasing our machines into production THIS EVENING.  Can you can them now?"
1286383862: <PipSqueek> 
1286383868: <hoamchan> that's better than not knowing what and what not to give a fuck about at all
1286383868: <PipSqueek> 
1286383888: <tinfoil_> The good thing is we do have a good paperwork trail so we know who to fire is something does happen

1286384196: <tinfoil_> ?
1286384196: <PipSqueek> 
1286384251: <fbx> his email sigs are being eaten by filters because they contain a jpg with links embedded
1286384251: <PipSqueek> 
1286384265: <fbx> so emails are flagged as spam
1286384265: <PipSqueek> 
1286384276: <tinfoil_> Well yeah
1286384276: <PipSqueek> 
1286384283: <tinfoil_> who is dumb enough to do that
1286384283: <PipSqueek> 
1286384297: <fbx> ouiji: tell your corporate masters they're morons and to not use a jpg with embedded links
1286384297: <]3d0g> I have a special contempt for asshats that have jpeg sigs.

1286384334: <tinfoil_> I loved the day when I linked my spamassassen to a caching OCR 
1286384334: <PipSqueek> 
1286384382: <tinfoil_> images?   Have words?   Must be spam.
1286384382: <PipSqueek> 
1286384406: <fbx> hah!
1286384406: <PipSqueek> 
1286384421: <fbx> so then each re-occurence went straight into file 13
1286384421: <PipSqueek> 
1286384421: <fbx> ?
1286384421: <PipSqueek> 
1286384438: <tinfoil_> Yeah, took an MD5 of all images
1286384438: <PipSqueek> 
1286384449: <tinfoil_> was less costly than re-scanning in OCR
1286384449: <PipSqueek> 
1286384471: <fbx> sp: occurrence
1286384471: <PipSqueek> 
1286384475: <fbx> sorry
1286384475: <PipSqueek> 
1286384477: <tinfoil_> thanks
1286384477: <PipSqueek> 
1286384529: <tinfoil_> It was a little more sophisticated than that (simple bayes)  - wanted to get it integrated into the main word analysis but never got to it
1286384529: <PipSqueek> 
1286384550: <tinfoil_> I do miss all the anti-spam work I did at comfluent
1286384550: <PipSqueek> 
1286384556: <tinfoil_> That was a hoot
1286384556: <PipSqueek> 
1286384640: <ouiji> Actually the signature is real simple, the links are plaintext, no images.. its just that there are 3 links with spamsucking favorite words and odd grammatical combinations 
1286384640: <PipSqueek> 
1286384657: <tinfoil_> send mhenry@neocrime.com a message.. I'm curious
1286384657: <PipSqueek> 
1286384696: <hoamchan> oh opinions: would you think an email address of wkannen@liverwur.st was unprofessional if used for resume/job hunting purposes?
1286384696: <PipSqueek> 
1286384716: <tinfoil_> It would make me chuckle
1286384716: <PipSqueek> 
1286384739: <hoamchan> and then you'd netstalk the domain
1286384739: <PipSqueek> 
1286384740: <tinfoil_> honestly
1286384740: <PipSqueek> 
1286384747: <tinfoil_> yeah
1286384747: <PipSqueek> 
1286384760: <tinfoil_> When I saw it was fairly anonymous, I'd probably put a point up for you

1286399192: <tinfoil_> ]3d0g: how so?
1286399192: <PipSqueek> 
1286399213: <tinfoil_> I still don't have any juniper experience
1286399213: <PipSqueek> 
1286399222: <tinfoil_> Probably never will at the point :-p
1286399222: <PipSqueek> 
1286399229: <fbx> why would you want to?
1286399229: <PipSqueek> 
1286399236: <fbx> that's like having nortel experience
1286399236: <PipSqueek> 
1286399241: <fbx> just about, anyway
1286399241: <PipSqueek> 
1286399252: <tinfoil_> Are you kidding?
1286399252: <PipSqueek> 
1286399290: <]3d0g> well, the one I'm resurrecting was on 8.0 Junos. Had to upgrade to 8.5 before I can upgrade to the latest 9.3. Oh, and 9.3 won't fit on the 256M CF card so I had to clone to a 2G CF card first.
1286399290: <PipSqueek> 
1286399295: <tinfoil_> Work on fat pipes and you're more likely to run into juniper than anything else
1286399295: <PipSqueek> 
1286399371: <tinfoil_> Oh, yeah, that is a pain.  That's a pretty big OS change though
1286399371: <PipSqueek> 
1286399382: <]3d0g> true
1286399382: <PipSqueek> 
1286399393: <]3d0g> router's been in storage for 3 years
1286399393: <PipSqueek> 
1286399412: <fbx> ok, big pipes. fine.
1286399412: <PipSqueek> 
1286399414: <tinfoil_> this for personal education and experimentation or for a project?
1286399414: <PipSqueek> 
1286399429: <fbx> they're what...5-10% of the market?
1286399430: <PipSqueek> 
1286399462: <tinfoil_> I've never seen a juniper running anything smaller than an OC-48  Of course, I was working an in ISP at the time
1286399462: <PipSqueek> 
1286399509: <tinfoil_> The best one was the redundant juni's running a total of 21 OC-192's
1286399509: <PipSqueek> 
1286399511: <fbx> that was the pipe i saw the only junis i've seen
1286399511: <PipSqueek> 
1286399528: <fbx> the size pipe
1286399528: <PipSqueek> 
1286399543: <fbx> course, i've never worked in a POP or with an ISP
1286399543: <PipSqueek> 
1286399604: <]3d0g> tinfoil_: edge router for a point-to-point DS3 to our new downtown Denver office.
1286399604: <PipSqueek> 
1286399615: <tinfoil_> Ahh, nice
1286399615: <PipSqueek> 
1286401758: <]3d0g> geeze. I had no real appreciation for how bad the G1 battery really was. G2 has been off charger since 5AM and it's still at 82%.
1286401758: <PipSqueek> 
1286402100: <tinfoil_> Wow - Epson P-3000 and Epson P-7000 - same hardware except one has 40Gb HDD and the other a 160Gb... the price difference?  >$300
1286402100: <PipSqueek> 
1286402183: <tinfoil_> What would the G1 be at?
1286402183: <PipSqueek> 
1286402204: <]3d0g> nearly dead
1286402204: <PipSqueek> 
1286402212: <tinfoil_> Wow
1286402212: <PipSqueek> 
1286402219: <tinfoil_> Yeah, that is bad
1286402219: <PipSqueek> 
1286402241: <tinfoil_> even my crappy droid lasts all day unless I forget to kill "movies" or something
1286402241: <PipSqueek> 
1286402271: <tinfoil_> A bug in movies keep the GPS engaged even when the app is in the background
1286402271: <PipSqueek> 
1286403323: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
1286405034: <dp> tinfoil_: why does "movies" need GPS?
1286405034: <PipSqueek> 
1286405428: <tinfoil_> To locate theaters near you
1286405428: <PipSqueek> 
1286405466: <tinfoil_> It's one of my favorite apps, amazingly enough
1286405466: <PipSqueek> 
1286433652: <hoamchan> holy crap.  42 down 33 up
1286433652: <PipSqueek> 
1286455421: <dp> ugh
1286455421: <PipSqueek> 
1286456093: <fbx> indeed
1286456093: <PipSqueek> 
1286456980: <dp> we're quickly finding out that our servers are not up to snuff for the amount of processing we're doing within PHP
1286456980: <PipSqueek> 
1286456995: <fbx> not good
1286456995: <PipSqueek> 
1286457034: <dp> yeah
1286457034: <PipSqueek> 
1286457045: <dp> brought up a second server the other day, and it's getting hammered as well
1286457045: <PipSqueek> 
1286458152: <fbx> i can't ping or connect to our new AV server, which is a HyperV virtual machine, and it's not connected on the Manager console
1286458152: <PipSqueek> 
1286458164: <fbx> it exists only in the HV server's memory
1286458164: <PipSqueek> 
1286458171: <fbx> awesomesauce
1286458171: <PipSqueek> 
1286460389: <dp> wow
1286460389: <PipSqueek> 
1286460395: <dp> no actual file behind it?
1286460395: <PipSqueek> 
1286461228: <fbx> yeah, there's a file...apparently i have to figure out which virtual process it is in memory
1286461228: <PipSqueek> 
1286461231: <fbx> killed it
1286461231: <PipSqueek> 
1286461238: <fbx> now it's restarting and reconnecting
1286461238: <PipSqueek> 
1286461257: <fbx> wow....showing abnormal shutdown page
1286461257: <PipSqueek> 
1286461267: <fbx> that was fucked up
1286461267: <PipSqueek> 
1286461283: <fbx> logging in
1286461283: <PipSqueek> 
1286461292: <fbx> let's see how far back we are now....
1286461292: <PipSqueek> 
1286461347: <fbx> great...seems we've gone back a snapshot or two
1286461347: <PipSqueek> 
1286461580: <fbx> snapshot is a month old
1286461580: <PipSqueek> 
1286461585: <fbx> taking a new one
1286461585: <PipSqueek> 
1286461587: <fbx> which is working
1286461587: <PipSqueek> 
1286461600: <fbx> wow...that was just...unpleasant
1286461600: <PipSqueek> 
1286462471: * hoamchan blinks
1286464742: --> ]3d0g (jkarp@6988929A.F4AE6A51.BF63E968.IP) has joined #lobby
1286464742: <PipSqueek> ]3d0g: Prost!
1286465484: <]3d0g> LOL, "elevator guy" posted yesterday is officially a Darwin award winner.
1286465484: <PipSqueek> 
1286465503: <]3d0g> Gene pool's a slightly safer place today.
1286465503: <PipSqueek> 
1286465504: <acr0nym> Uh, yeah....  tinfoil_ posted his Darwin Award within mere minutes....
1286465504: <PipSqueek> 
1286465614: <]3d0g> well, lookie that. so he did. I must've reached my tinfoil_ limit by that point. :)
1286465614: <PipSqueek> 
1286465620: <acr0nym> Heh.
1286465620: <PipSqueek> 
1286466566: <]3d0g> Best ad EVER. http://gizmodo.com/5657918/this-controversial-climate-change-ad-made-sony-drop-its-sponsorship

1286467395: <]3d0g> hey telecon - you still getting slow speedtests on HPSA+?
1286467395: <PipSqueek> 
1286467444: <]3d0g> I ran one just outside the building yesterday and got 2K down, 600 up.
1286467444: <PipSqueek> 
1286468287: <tinfoil_> Bleh
1286468287: <PipSqueek> 
1286468429: <tinfoil_> Trying to convince Verizon that I actually did send my phone back to them.   "No, really - This is the tracking number.  Signed for by XXX"  
1286468429: <PipSqueek> 
1286468455: <tinfoil_> RMA
1286468455: <PipSqueek> 
1286468478: <acr0nym> Awesome.
1286468478: <PipSqueek> 
1286468480: <acr0nym> Assholes.
1286468480: <PipSqueek> 
1286468530: <tinfoil_> Yeah, you kinda notice something's up when your bill is $800
1286468530: <PipSqueek> 
1286468680: <acr0nym> Charging you for the phone?
1286468680: <PipSqueek> 
1286468805: <tinfoil_> Yeah
1286468805: <PipSqueek> 
1286468823: <tinfoil_> A Droid at full brand new market value - as if anyone ever paid that much for it
1286468823: <PipSqueek> 
1286468841: <tinfoil_> Among my other normal charges
1286468841: <PipSqueek> 
1286468898: <tinfoil_> I took about $600 off my bill, paid for last month and this month (a head of time).
1286468898: <PipSqueek> 
1286468915: <tinfoil_> Disputing $600 now
1286468915: <PipSqueek> 
1286470222: <TeleCon> ]3d0g: o
1286470222: <PipSqueek> 
1286470229: <TeleCon> I'll go test.
1286470229: <PipSqueek> 
1286470706: <TeleCon> 1800/610
1286470706: <PipSqueek> 
1286472308: <hoamchan> i just upped my home servix to 35 meg symmetric 
1286472308: <PipSqueek> 
1286472325: <tinfoil_> Nic
1286472325: <PipSqueek> 
1286472326: <tinfoil_> e
1286472326: <PipSqueek> 
1286472327: <hoamchan> completely gratuitous really but it was part of a bundle
1286472327: <PipSqueek> 
1286472342: <tinfoil_> Who's your ISP?
1286472342: <PipSqueek> 
1286472347: <hoamchan> verizon fios
1286472347: <PipSqueek> 
1286472365: <hoamchan> speed test from a while ago was 42 down and 33 up
1286472365: <PipSqueek> 
1286472374: <hoamchan> down speeds may not be capped at all
1286472374: <PipSqueek> 
1286472688: <]3d0g> you know where you can stick your fios, right?
1286472688: <PipSqueek> 
1286472774: <]3d0g> I wish the G2 indicated when it truly had an HSPA+ connection. 
1286472774: <PipSqueek> 
1286472999: <tinfoil_> Verizon pulled out of FIOS in WA
1286472999: <PipSqueek> 
1286473001: <tinfoil_> *grumble*
1286473001: <PipSqueek> 
1286473071: * fbx will likely go back to verizon when they sweep through the hood again, offering what he's got via comcast, but double the 'net speed at the same price, and a check to cover pulling out of comcast
1286473100: <fbx> that's what comcast did, so my bet is VZN is coming to do that soon too
1286473100: <PipSqueek> 
1286473106: <fbx> next year, likely
1286473106: <PipSqueek> 
1286473114: <tinfoil_> :-)
1286473114: <PipSqueek> 
1286473132: <hoamchan> when there's competition, everyone wins
1286473132: <PipSqueek> 
1286473156: <fbx> i'm still only 10/5, but that's choice. think i could get 20/10 w/o having a business contract.
1286473156: <PipSqueek> 
1286473161: <fbx> hoamchan: no lie
1286473161: <PipSqueek> 
1286473197: <fbx> i would even like it if the DSL provider down the road could get into the neighborhood, although i think 20/10 is prolly out of their league
1286473197: <PipSqueek> 
1286473483: <hoamchan> i wonder if wireless will ever hit a point where it breaks the wired last mile monopolies
1286473483: <PipSqueek> 
1286473527: <fbx> if it does, you can be damned sure that's an offering some bigass company will get in front of
1286473527: <PipSqueek> 
1286473548: <fbx> why else would google sign on to net neutrality that doesn't include wireless?
1286473548: <PipSqueek> 
1286473557: <acr0nym> Isn't that the point of WiMax?
1286473557: <PipSqueek> 
1286473568: <fbx> you have to wire it somewhere
1286473568: <PipSqueek> 
1286473575: <tinfoil_> My WiMAX has become worse since moving in
1286473575: <PipSqueek> 
1286473579: <fbx> that's the bottleneck on competition
1286473579: <PipSqueek> 
1286473597: <acr0nym> Arguably, that's the bottleneck on verything....
1286473597: <PipSqueek> 
1286473614: <fbx> well, yeah...but we were subsetting wireless
1286473614: <PipSqueek> 
1286473627: <acr0nym> It's just as easy for an ISP to sell DSL to too many customers, without enough upstream.
1286473627: <PipSqueek> 
1286473644: <fbx> whoever owns the last leg of wires - regardless of how they get connectivity to you - gets the bucks
1286473644: <PipSqueek> 
1286473671: <fbx> could be VZN, could be google WiMax
1286473671: <PipSqueek> 
1286473675: <tinfoil_> I went to check out what Compost could offer me (since I live in a non-residential area, assuming service will be good at night, unlike when I was in CO)
1286473675: <PipSqueek> 
1286473692: <tinfoil_> Their check-for-service page gives me HTTP-500 when I put in my address
1286473692: <PipSqueek> 
1286473696: <fbx> i'd like to break that, but...who'd pay for the wimax wires up the line? you? me?
1286473696: <PipSqueek> 
1286473718: <fbx> tinfoil_: they knew it was you ;)
1286473718: <PipSqueek> 
1286473732: <fbx> "michael who? FUCK that guy!"
1286473732: <PipSqueek> 
1286473751: <tinfoil_> Didn't put my name in
1286473751: <PipSqueek> 
1286473767: <tinfoil_> You guys remember how bad it was right?  I'd drop off the net 20+ times a day
1286473767: <PipSqueek> 
1286473788: <tinfoil_> They threatened to charge me for sending a tech out, because every time I'd call, they could talk to my modem
1286473788: <PipSqueek> 
1286473820: <tinfoil_> Finally hoamchan's manager called support and they promptly called me
1286473820: <PipSqueek> 
1286473821: <tinfoil_> came out
1286473821: <PipSqueek> 
1286473828: <tinfoil_> found out my line was fucked
1286473828: <PipSqueek> 
1286473832: <tinfoil_> my neighborhood oversubscribed
1286473832: <PipSqueek> 
1286473856: <tinfoil_> Those were the days :-0
1286473856: <PipSqueek> 
1286473866: <fbx> i think almost everything is oversubscribed to be honest
1286473866: <PipSqueek> 
1286473877: <fbx> at some tier, anyway
1286473877: <PipSqueek> 
1286473920: <tinfoil_> We had a conversation about that yesterday
1286473920: <PipSqueek> 
1286473931: <tinfoil_> I heard something about Clear was caught throttling
1286473931: <PipSqueek> 
1286473943: <fbx> i believe a lot more traffic is DE than we think
1286473943: <PipSqueek> 
1286474002: <tinfoil_> Damn compost offers 50/10 now?
1286474002: <PipSqueek> 
1286474011: <fbx> where you are?
1286474011: <PipSqueek> 
1286474013: <tinfoil_> The most I could get in CO was 5/128k
1286474013: <PipSqueek> 
1286474024: <tinfoil_> yeah
1286474024: <PipSqueek> 
1286474026: <fbx> jeebus..what woods were you living in?
1286474026: <PipSqueek> 
1286474031: <tinfoil_> $99/mo for 50/10
1286474031: <PipSqueek> 
1286474039: <fbx> not bad
1286474039: <PipSqueek> 
1286474040: <tinfoil_> that's how much I pay for 6/1 DSL
1286474040: <PipSqueek> 
1286474084: * fbx is prolly discard eligible
1286474092: <tinfoil_> discard?
1286474092: <PipSqueek> 
1286474103: <fbx> frame relay term
1286474103: <PipSqueek> 
1286474110: <tinfoil_> Oh
1286474110: <PipSqueek> 
1286474114: <tinfoil_> Never played with frame
1286474114: <PipSqueek> 
1286474121: <fbx> but still applicable to oversubs
1286474122: <PipSqueek> 
1286474137: <fbx> TCP calls it "retransmit"
1286474137: <PipSqueek> 
1286474139: <fbx> ;)
1286474139: <PipSqueek> 
1286474183: <fbx> congested? check the DE bit in the packet, re-prioritize and fuck those with DE set.
1286474183: <PipSqueek> 
1286474197: <tinfoil_> I do miss being my own DSL ISP
1286474197: <PipSqueek> 
1286474204: <tinfoil_> That was a lot of fun
1286474204: <PipSqueek> 
1286474443: <tinfoil_> Woah... I go to sign up for compost, their form has the wrong address (similar to what I entered, the next street over) so I change it back to what I entered, and they won't let me continue.
1286474443: <PipSqueek> 
1286474448: <tinfoil_> Grrr
1286474448: <PipSqueek> 
1286474472: <fbx> save yourself the trouble and call em
1286474472: <PipSqueek> 
1286474489: <fbx> if that goes awry, pretend to be someone a street over
1286474489: <PipSqueek> 
1286474511: <tinfoil_> Phone == evil
1286474511: <PipSqueek> 
1286474512: <tinfoil_> :-)
1286474512: <PipSqueek>

1286474669: <hoamchan> verizon operators can game the system in ways you can't do on your own via web
1286474669: <PipSqueek> 
1286474685: <tinfoil_> Agreed
1286474685: <PipSqueek> 
1286474694: <tinfoil_> I just like to whine (if you didn't notice)
1286474694: <PipSqueek> 
1286474699: <hoamchan> that's why i have 35/35 and all the movie channels for less than what 25/5 and only showtime+hbo previously
1286474699: <PipSqueek> 
1286474708: <hoamchan> they'd rather get you on a contract than lose you entirely
1286474708: <PipSqueek> 
1286474721: <fbx> how long are you in for?
1286474721: <PipSqueek> 
1286474741: <hoamchan> have to keep the service 2 years but can change the servie plan within that time
1286474741: <PipSqueek> 
1286474743: <acr0nym> Which is funny.  They weren't even prepared to lie to me about sending a HD cable box with HDMI instead of component, to keep me.
1286474743: <PipSqueek> 
1286474770: <acr0nym> "My component input is in use.  I have 3 open HDMI ports.  You do the math."
1286474770: <PipSqueek> 
1286474780: <fbx> acr0nym: were you staring at the back of the box they'd sent? :)

1286474780: <PipSqueek>

1286474788: <PipSqueek> 
1286474790: <acr0nym> Nope, on the phone.
1286474790: <PipSqueek> 
1286475722: <tinfoil_> Heh, my location has never has Comcast server before
1286475722: <PipSqueek> 
1286476113: <tinfoil_> I got around the fact people have about 5 different ways to manage IP tables around here for stuff I need.  Wrote a script to check and see if my iptables rules are in place, if not, insert them ahead of everyone else's rules.  I put that script into /etc/cron.daily
1286476113: <PipSqueek> 
1286476116: <tinfoil_> :-p
1286476116: <PipSqueek> 
1286476125: <tinfoil_> If I have any problems will move it to /etc/cron.hourly
1286476125: <PipSqueek> 
1286476242: <tinfoil_> I also notified the linux team that I'm prepared to help them clean up the iptables mess
1286476242: <PipSqueek> 
1286476262: <tinfoil_> we now have a linux team to do all this stuff that we hired like 100 (non cooredinated) consultants to build
1286476262: <PipSqueek> 
1286476355: <tinfoil_> *LOVE* the fact that they told the development groups that if they want any new machines installed or old ones upgraded that they only accept RPM's and documentation on how to configure it.  Next step?  Removing their sudo privs
1286476355: <PipSqueek> 
1286476379: <tinfoil_> That's part of what I've been doing
1286476379: <PipSqueek> 
1286476419: <tinfoil_> "Need privs?  Really?  What commands do you run?  Give me a detailed list, and I will restrict you to those commands."

1286480532: <fbx> nice
1286480532: <PipSqueek> 
1286480583: <tinfoil_> One thing I like about the continuation of DSL type technologies is that it puts old copper to use
1286480583: <PipSqueek> 
1286480588: <tinfoil_> and effectively
1286480588: <PipSqueek> 
1286480600: <fbx> old copper...dark fiber...might as well use it, right?
1286480600: <PipSqueek> 
1286480632: <tinfoil_> The company that hosts acr0nym's box actually runs "ethernet" over POTS.  it's actually a 50Mb DSL
1286480632: <PipSqueek> 
1286480655: <acr0nym> If you're actually close to one of their switches.  Dammit.
1286480655: <tinfoil_> (up to 50Mb)
1286480655: <PipSqueek> 
1286480655: <PipSqueek> 
1286480657: <fbx> heh
1286480657: <tinfoil_> uses 2 pair
1286480657: <PipSqueek> 
1286480657: <PipSqueek> 
1286480664: <fbx> nothing "plain old" about that
1286480664: <PipSqueek> 
1286480688: <tinfoil_> There are caveats, but still
1286480688: <PipSqueek> 
1286480692: <tinfoil_> the technology has been there
1286480692: <PipSqueek>

1286480891: <fbx> TeleCon: I like your CobraCow
1286480891: <PipSqueek> 
1286480900: <tinfoil_> When I was at comfluent we were eyeing a box that could multiplex 10 x 10Gb ethernet into a single pair of fiber
1286480900: <PipSqueek> 
1286480914: <fbx> spiffy
1286480914: <PipSqueek> 
1286480923: <fbx> tinfoil_: connected to a juni router? ;)
1286480923: <PipSqueek> 
1286480952: <tinfoil_> When I left we had just aquired another datacenter about 1mi away and owned dark fiber between them
1286480952: <PipSqueek> 
1286480983: <tinfoil_> The main datacenter had the largest meet-me room in denver, but little space... 
1286480983: <PipSqueek> 
1286481000: <tinfoil_> no routing
1286481000: <PipSqueek>

1286481224: <tinfoil_> Every backbone provider that came through Denver had drops in Comfluent
1286481224: <PipSqueek> 
1286481233: <fbx> see? i told you i'd never worked for a POP or ISP
1286481233: <PipSqueek> 
1286481251: <tinfoil_> Clear that affects your google skills :-0
1286481251: <PipSqueek>

1286481263: <fbx> i didn't even google it

1286481300: <PipSqueek>

1286481362: <PipSqueek> 
1286481534: <fbx> so...a disaster event would be if, say, one wilshire was toppled by an earthquake, eh?
1286481534: <PipSqueek> 
1286481577: <tinfoil_> that's one example, yes
1286481577: <PipSqueek> 
1286481607: <tinfoil_> Seattle has a huge MMR at the Westin too
1286481607: <PipSqueek> 
1286481617: <fbx> 260 interconnected POPs in a building only miles from an active fault line
1286481617: <tinfoil_> I think it's one of the largest in the country
1286481617: <PipSqueek> 
1286481617: <PipSqueek> 
1286481620: <fbx> awesome
1286481620: <PipSqueek> 
1286481627: <tinfoil_> The thing about MMR's is that there is usually an IX near by too
1286481627: <PipSqueek> 
1286481642: <fbx> yeah, but in an earthquake....
1286481642: <PipSqueek> 
1286481644: <tinfoil_> and they are also usually located near major telco
1286481644: <PipSqueek> 
1286481719: <fbx> and wait a tic....was that acr0nym linking wikipedia AGAIN?
1286481719: <PipSqueek> 
1286481735: <acr0nym> Yeah, I was also kicking ass on your google skills.
1286481735: <PipSqueek> 
1286481757: <tinfoil_> Which is why I was really worried during the DNC a couple years ago.   The majority of the major players in the democratic party were located a block away from the main telco hub in denver.  a big enough bomb would have taken them and a significant portion of midwest telcom offline
1286481757: <PipSqueek> 
1286481758: <fbx> i told you i passed on google, dude
1286481758: <PipSqueek> 
1286481772: <fbx> is it a win if you roll down the track alone?
1286481772: <PipSqueek> 
1286481788: <acr0nym> Huh?  tinfoil_ and I were basically simultaneous....
1286481788: <PipSqueek> 
1286481801: <fbx> oh
1286481801: <PipSqueek> 
1286481806: <fbx> i read "kicking your ass"

1286481809: <PipSqueek> 
1286481844: <fbx> fine. thought i'd get away with a punt there, but no...
1286481844: <PipSqueek> 
1286481867: <tinfoil_> fbx: Also, most major cel providers do a lot of interconnecting in MMR's
1286481867: <PipSqueek> 
1286481887: <tinfoil_> Comfluent going down would take out most of the celphones in Denver.

1286485661: <-- tinfoil_ has quit (Quit: ttl)
1286486376: <]3d0g> As I understand it, there isn't really a different radio for hspa+. It's just the G2 has the capability of handling the full 21Mbs of the spec. I'm sure the N1 can at least partially take advantage of the new TMO bandwidth. 
1286486376: <PipSqueek> 
1286486439: <]3d0g> In fact, TMO is claiming many of their existing phones can take advantage of hspa+
1286486439: <PipSqueek> 
1286489385: <TeleCon> I got the same numbers speedtest wise from both phones.

1287418252: <tinfoil> morning!
1287418252: <PipSqueek> 
1287418830: <dp> oi
1287418830: <PipSqueek> 
1287419153: <tinfoil> It's funny, shortly after we put out an announcement that we're out of development money and we'll not be moving forward with any projects not currently in production, tripwire suddenly becomes boring to watch
1287419153: <PipSqueek> 
1287419176: <tinfoil> I was out of the office since Wednesday, and there's about 10 changes total since then
1287419176: <PipSqueek> 
1287419222: <tinfoil> Aparently we'll be de-com'ing all the machines not in production, too, meaning it will get even more boring
1287419222: <PipSqueek> 
1287420566: <dp> ok.  Tie::File is good stuff when you don't want to read in a 10GB file
1287420566: <PipSqueek> 
1287420907: <tinfoil> What happened?
1287420907: <PipSqueek> 
1287421784: <dp> well, if I want to loop over the lines in a file, I can use Tie::File to tie each line to an array, without reading the whole file in to memory
1287421784: <PipSqueek> 
1287421815: <dp> http://search.cpan.org/~mjd/Tie-File-0.96/lib/Tie/File.pm
1287421815: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/7+5k (Tie::File - search.cpan.org)
1287421848: <tinfoil> Wow, that's interesting
1287421848: <PipSqueek> 
1287421894: <tinfoil> I suppose the alternative for tieing to an array would be to scan the entire file and keep an index of where every line begins in memory.... or iterate the file directly, but then you lose the random accessibility
1287421894: <PipSqueek> 
1287421972: <dp> right
1287421972: <PipSqueek> 
1287422217: <acr0nym> Yes, Instapaper is sincerely bad ass, by the way.
1287422217: <PipSqueek> 
1287422265: <dp> :)

1287423269: <dp> tinfoil: instapaper is awesome
1287423269: <PipSqueek> 
1287424043: <TeleCon> I use google readers mark unread for the same thing.
1287424043: <PipSqueek> 
1287425533: <dp> I star stuff in Reader for that
1287425533: <PipSqueek> 
1287426783: <TeleCon> I used to do that, until I realized I would forget to read them later.
1287426783: <PipSqueek> 
1287428170: * tinfoil agrees with telecon
1287433557: <tinfoil> Damn, creating a facebook page for my event photography stuff worked better than I expected
1287433557: <PipSqueek> 
1287433566: <tinfoil> It's self promoting
1287433566: <PipSqueek> 
1287433674: <tinfoil> 1/3 of the people who follow it are not friends of mine.  They are tagging the images, which in turn brings in more people
1287433674: <PipSqueek> 
1287433779: <acr0nym> Heh.  Interesting.  If I try to type "Sinisterbrain", my hand auto-creates "Sinistar"

1287434475: <PipSqueek>

1287434692: <PipSqueek> 
1287434754: <tinfoil> acr0nym: I'm trying to get myself into being an event photographer for a specific event.  Best way to do that is to show I can do the work.  Now if only I could compose my event images better.  Bleh.
1287434754: <PipSqueek> 
1287434804: <fbx> TeleCon: exactly. i clicked my cow, got no share screen. just a blank page.

1287435749: <tinfoil> This is a silly idea, but I wonder what would happen if I took a time-lapse series of photos and combined them as an HDR photo
1287435749: <PipSqueek> 
1287435786: <tinfoil> Something like a skyline over 24 hours

1287436666: <PipSqueek> 
1287436961: <tinfoil> TeleCon: Worth trying, eh?  :-)
1287436961: <PipSqueek> 
1287437520: <TeleCon> Exactly
1287437520: <PipSqueek> 
1287437959: <tinfoil> I did produce my first HDR photos this weekend
1287437959: <PipSqueek> 
1287437961: <tinfoil> came out pretty cool
1287437961: <PipSqueek> 
1287437964: <acr0nym> Meh.
1287437964: <PipSqueek>

1287437965: <PipSqueek> 
1287437965: <TeleCon> cool
1287437965: <PipSqueek> 
1287437978: <tinfoil> It's a pain in the ass on linux
1287437978: <PipSqueek> 
1287437984: <acr0nym> I do like that your HDR doesn't look completely fake, or overblown, or the like.
1287437984: <PipSqueek> 
1287438003: <tinfoil> Yeah, color mapping can get really surreal looking
1287438003: <PipSqueek> 
1287438168: <tinfoil> That's where you map 32bit floating point data to an 8bit image
1287438168: <PipSqueek>

1287438172: <PipSqueek>

1287588721: <acr0nym> Goddammit.  I should totally learn when to stay in bed.
1287588721: <PipSqueek> 
1287588856: <TeleCon>  What happened?
1287588856: <PipSqueek> 
1287588877: <acr0nym> Heh, the usual onslaught of dumb tickets.  Also, bed rules.
1287588877: <PipSqueek> 
1287588898: <TeleCon> bed does rule.
1287588898: <PipSqueek>

1287589706: <PipSqueek> 
1287589728: <fbx> she wants to be my friend...and you're my only link to her (i think)
1287589728: <PipSqueek> 
1287589767: <TeleCon> Acro would be a link, too.
1287589767: <PipSqueek> 
1287589775: <fbx> ah
1287589775: <PipSqueek> 
1287589776: <acr0nym> Nope.
1287589776: <PipSqueek> 
1287589780: <acr0nym> She's not actually my friend.
1287589780: <TeleCon> Someone we went to High School with.
1287589780: <PipSqueek> 
1287589780: <PipSqueek> 
1287589784: <TeleCon> Oh, OK
1287589784: <PipSqueek> 
1287589787: <acr0nym> On facebook, that is.
1287589787: <PipSqueek> 
1287589792: <acr0nym> Arguably, also, in person.
1287589792: <PipSqueek> 
1287589800: <acr0nym> Sine I haven't seen her for probably 20 years.
1287589800: <PipSqueek> 
1287589804: <acr0nym> Since, even.
1287589804: <PipSqueek> 
1287589804: <TeleCon> Yeah, given the time frame since 
1287589804: <PipSqueek> 
1287589807: <TeleCon> What he said.
1287589807: <PipSqueek> 
1287589812: <fbx> i assume she doesn't really want to be my friend, she was just overanxious choosing friends of friends?
1287589812: <PipSqueek> 
1287589829: <acr0nym> Or, mebbe, "Chris White" is a pretty common name?
1287589829: <PipSqueek> 
1287589830: <acr0nym> Heh.
1287589830: <PipSqueek> 
1287589835: <fbx> nah
1287589835: <PipSqueek> 
1287589835: <TeleCon> Maybe she really liked something said in a comment or something.
1287589835: <PipSqueek> 
1287589850: <acr0nym> Or, mebbe she's in marketing, and is actually sort of a spammer.
1287589850: <acr0nym> Heh.
1287589850: <PipSqueek> 
1287589850: <PipSqueek>

1287589868: <fbx> 97.1 MM now
1287589868: <PipSqueek> 
1287589904: <fbx> she could like the comedian Chris White, owner of chriswhitesucks.com

1287624636: <PipSqueek>

1287624658: <PipSqueek> 
1287624665: <mnchan> i just splat my tuned .e16 over it
1287624665: <PipSqueek>

1287625386: <PipSqueek> 
1287625450: <mnchan> included a screenshot of the main window so you can see what i autostart
1287625450: <PipSqueek> 
1287625486: <dp> ok
1287625486: <PipSqueek>

1287625540: <PipSqueek> 
1287625547: <mnchan> that's in the .e16 dir
1287625547: <PipSqueek> 
1287625700: <dp> hrm. I seem to be missing something; all my corners are blocky
1287625700: <PipSqueek> 
1287625705: <mnchan> ?
1287625705: <PipSqueek> 
1287625717: <dp> one sec
1287625717: <PipSqueek> 
1287625727: <mnchan> did you unpack my entire filesets in your home dir?
1287625727: <PipSqueek> 
1287625731: <mnchan> and then relog?
1287625731: <PipSqueek> 
1287625733: <dp> yep
1287625733: <PipSqueek> 
1287625760: <mnchan> middle click, themes, choose lightone
1287625760: <PipSqueek> 
1287625765: <mnchan> if lightone is a choice

1287625771: <PipSqueek> 
1287625774: <dp> that's better
1287625774: <PipSqueek> 
1287625782: <mnchan> also try maint - purge all caches
1287625782: <PipSqueek> 
1287625794: <mnchan> you might need to set your gnome background and your e background both
1287625794: <PipSqueek> 
1287625800: <mnchan> they kinda fight each other
1287625800: <PipSqueek> 
1287625868: <dp> keyboard shortcuts?
1287625868: <PipSqueek>

1287625964: <mnchan> click on the background
1287625964: <PipSqueek> 
1287625967: <mnchan> left click
1287625967: <PipSqueek> 
1287625969: <dp> that's what drives me crazy about most WMs.  It's so difficult to set up keyboard shortcuts
1287625969: <PipSqueek> 
1287625972: <mnchan> user apps
1287625972: <PipSqueek> 
1287625980: <mnchan> eterm or xterm

1287625996: <PipSqueek> 
1287626001: <mnchan> otherwise it would be in the menu
1287626001: <PipSqueek> 
1287626017: <mnchan> there ARE tons of keyboard shortcuts and they are editable but i never really needed them
1287626017: <PipSqueek>

1287626049: <PipSqueek>

1287626107: <PipSqueek> 
1287626274: <mnchan> yes but it didn't do hangovers
1287626274: <PipSqueek> 
1287626295: <mnchan> like if you slide a window off one virtual screen you'd expecte to see the dangly bits on the adjacent virtual screens right?
1287626295: <PipSqueek> 
1287626307: <mnchan> it didn't do that when i checked it out years ago
1287626307: <PipSqueek> 
1287627053: <mnchan> i only just discovered ctrl shift cursor keys would move virtuals
1287627053: <PipSqueek> 
1287627063: <mnchan> er
1287627063: <PipSqueek> 
1287627069: <mnchan> shift alt cursor
1287627069: <PipSqueek> 
1287627097: <mnchan> otherwise just mousing to the edge will flip

1287679868: <PipSqueek>

1287689092: <mnchan> alt left click drag
1287689092: <PipSqueek> 
1287689109: <dp> ahhhhh, that's better
1287689109: <PipSqueek> 
1287689121: <mnchan> or right click on it and close and make a new icon box with the parameters you like
1287689121: <PipSqueek> 
1287689172: <mnchan> and alt right click -> remember settings will determine whether it tracks changes (remembers without you having to hit remember/apply)
1287689172: <PipSqueek> 
1287689202: <mnchan> i used to have the icon box invisible like the systray but it makes it hard to edit when you do that

1288118160: <PipSqueek> 
1288118190: <tinfoil> Which makes a significant difference when copying 6Tb of data
1288118190: <PipSqueek> 
1288118455: <dp> or even 6Gb
1288118455: <PipSqueek> 
1288119261: <tinfoil> Yeah
1288119261: <PipSqueek>

1288119334: <dp> it amazes me how slow data transfer can be
1288119334: <PipSqueek>

1288119351: <PipSqueek>

1288119406: <tinfoil> Not even close
1288119406: <PipSqueek>

1288119662: <PipSqueek> 
1288119672: <tinfoil> The OS, hardware, what?
1288119672: <PipSqueek>

1288121580: <PipSqueek>

1288122326: <PipSqueek> 
1288122341: <tinfoil> For like 6 years
1288122341: <PipSqueek> 
1288122347: <tinfoil> Not in the last 3 though
1288122347: <PipSqueek> 
1288122355: <dp> hrm
1288122355: <PipSqueek> 
1288122382: <tinfoil> It's very good if you have a specific goal in mind
1288122382: <PipSqueek> 
1288122387: <tinfoil> but it takes work
1288122387: <PipSqueek> 
1288122404: <dp> yeah, lighter weight binaries
1288122404: <PipSqueek> 
1288122846: <tinfoil> I had a whole desktop running nothing but GTK2 apps
1288122846: <PipSqueek> 
1288122855: <tinfoil> no gnome/kde/xfce/whatever
1288122855: <PipSqueek> 
1288122865: <tinfoil> It was pretty good.  :-)
1288122865: <PipSqueek> 
1288122869: <tinfoil> Used OpenBox as the manager
1288122869: <PipSqueek> 
1288122882: <dp> I just don't like the way 99% of GTK2 apps look
1288122882: <PipSqueek> 
1288122885: <tinfoil> also used the keyboard one when I didn't want to be friendly
1288122885: <PipSqueek> 
1288122898: <tinfoil> GTK2 isn't the issue, it's the apps :-0

1288122899: <PipSqueek>

1288122954: <PipSqueek> 
1288123166: <tinfoil> What frustrates me is that when KDE went to QT4, it went to crap
1288123166: <PipSqueek> 
1288123206: <tinfoil> Friend of mine was showing hhis comercial app migration from QT3 to QT4.  They added features, make it look better, reduce code size by over 30%, it ran faster, and used less memory
1288123206: <PipSqueek> 
1288123232: <tinfoil> I had so much expectation that KDE would have the same results
1288123232: <PipSqueek> 
1288123248: <tinfoil> It ended up less features, more ugly, less usable, and same performance

1288191886: <TeleCon> of course, now that I've mentioned it, it stopped.
1288191886: <PipSqueek>

1288194819: <PipSqueek>

1288194832: <PipSqueek>

1288198810: <dp> TeleCon: yep
1288198810: <PipSqueek>

1288199101: <PipSqueek> 
1288199122: <TeleCon> First day it was available retail.
1288199122: <PipSqueek> 
1288199353: <]3d0g> weird. I could have sworn you were asking me about getting it after mine came in
1288199353: <PipSqueek>

1288203887: <ouiji> bannanna
1288203887: <PipSqueek> 
1288203962: <ouiji> anyone know if the CallerID info is set by the VoIP provider, or in the software? Or does it depend? [Cisco Unity]
1288203962: <PipSqueek> 
1288203991: <TeleCon> I don't know.
1288203991: <PipSqueek> 
1288204350: <ouiji> but.. but.. your name is TeleCon
1288204350: <PipSqueek> 
1288204358: <ouiji> =(
1288204358: <PipSqueek> 
1288204489: <fbx> we're running a Vertical phone system (read: Comdial) which sets that in the software, just for comparison
1288204489: <PipSqueek> 
1288204595: <fbx> isn't unity your pbx?
1288204595: <PipSqueek> 
1288204786: <TeleCon> I'll take C
1288204786: <PipSqueek> 
1288204816: <TeleCon> I would imagine the voip provder could over ride whatever was set in unity.
1288204816: <PipSqueek> 
1288204832: <fbx> i'll agree with that
1288204832: <PipSqueek> 
1288204848: <fbx> because i've seen it happen
1288204848: <PipSqueek> 
1288204849: <fbx> !
1288204849: <PipSqueek> 
1288204876: <fbx> also seen the telco override callerID in some cases
1288204876: <PipSqueek> 
1288205090: <acr0nym> Yeah, we have a big discussion currently about CallerID, at CU.  Currently, pretty much all outgoing calls get the same trunk # on caller ID.  There's a project to allow people to send their actual desk extension.
1288205090: <PipSqueek> 
1288205130: <fbx> only pain in that is picking through the pbx setups for each phone and inputting that ID
1288205130: <PipSqueek> 
1288205143: <fbx> worse pain is keeping up with personnel moves
1288205143: <PipSqueek> 
1288205144: <fbx> ugh
1288205144: <PipSqueek> 
1288206783: <ouiji> I see where I can set the Caller ID number settings, but I can't figure out how to alter what text comes up.. like when it pops up on the caller ID on the other end.. where does the number to text ID lookup happen? I guess I just don't understand how the numbers are identified. if it travels with the outgiong call all as one packet.. or if the end the callerID is on checks the number against a database somewhere
1288206783: <PipSqueek> 
1288208055: <dp> ugh.  emerge --sync && emerge -uavDN world; this may take a while
1288208055: <PipSqueek> 
1288208452: <dp> once we get enough amd64 boxes on gentoo, I'll set up distcc to make this work a little better
1288208452: <PipSqueek> 
1288210559: <]3d0g> generally, CID comes from you. Name comes from reverse directory lookup @ telco.
1288210559: <PipSqueek> 
1288210621: <]3d0g> So while I push extensions back from my PBX to the telco, all numbers show as "Time Warner" on CID.
1288210621: <PipSqueek> 
1288211707: <ouiji> So if you wanted to change Time Warner to say Tizzy Wizzy (and you had all permission necessary) how would you go about it?
1288211707: <PipSqueek> 
1288212435: <acr0nym> 14:15 < ]3d0g> generally, CID comes from you. Name comes from reverse directory lookup @ telco.
1288212435: <PipSqueek> 
1288212445: <acr0nym> Have the telco that owns the number change it....
1288212445: <PipSqueek> 
1288212873: <]3d0g> To fart with name, I think you've got to work with the telco to accept out-of-band ANI
1288212873: <PipSqueek> 
1288215263: <KCAEchan> windup girl was excellent thank you
1288215263: <PipSqueek>

1288215870: <PipSqueek>

1288215918: <PipSqueek> 
1288215920: <acr0nym> They released it for free when IO9 made it the "book club" book.
1288215920: <PipSqueek> 
1288215951: <acr0nym> A wise choice, I think.  Didn't it win a Hugo, or Nebula?
1288215951: <PipSqueek> 
1288215956: <]3d0g> yup
1288215956: <PipSqueek> 
1288215979: <acr0nym> Oh, both.  Wow.

1288304038: <tinfoil> You phrase it wrong...
1288304038: <PipSqueek>

1288634126: <tinfoil> why?
1288634126: <PipSqueek> 
1288634136: <dp> not exactly sfw
1288634136: <PipSqueek>

1288634152: <PipSqueek>

1288634196: <dp> ]3d0g: your workplace may have different standards. that much tit would get some people fired
1288634196: <PipSqueek>

1288634225: <PipSqueek> 
1288634249: <tinfoil> I forget her name, honestly
1288634249: <PipSqueek>

1288634317: <tinfoil> Yeah, that's her
1288634317: <PipSqueek> 
1288634332: <acr0nym> That should have occurred to me more quickly.  I thought she was Portland.
1288634332: <PipSqueek> 
1288634344: <acr0nym> Yeah, she's a wingnut, but fantastic massage therapist.
1288634344: <PipSqueek> 
1288634360: <acr0nym> She and a friend had the corner of the contest room for massage this year.
1288634360: <PipSqueek> 
1288634366: <acr0nym> She's also HNN-related.
1288634366: <PipSqueek> 
1288634375: <tinfoil> Yeah
1288634375: <PipSqueek> 
1288634377: <tinfoil> She told me
1288634377: <PipSqueek> 
1288634380: <tinfoil> She asked if I read it
1288634380: <PipSqueek> 
1288634384: <tinfoil> I said I was tired of security
1288634384: <PipSqueek>

1288636132: <PipSqueek> 
1288636142: <tinfoil> I'm still figuring it out
1288636142: <PipSqueek> 
1288636157: <acr0nym> No images make it to the feed, just the links for other social sites.
1288636157: <PipSqueek> 
1288636201: <tinfoil> I'll work on that...
1288636201: <PipSqueek> 
1288636281: <tinfoil> images should be making the feed though
1288636281: <PipSqueek> 
1288636284: <tinfoil> no idea why they aren't
1288636284: <PipSqueek> 
1288636285: <acr0nym> Nope.

1288637275: <PipSqueek> 
1288637293: <tinfoil> acr0nym: Ok, figured out the social crap, but still no images.  
1288637293: <PipSqueek> 
1288637318: <acr0nym> Heh, doesn't that mean it'll largely be blank articles, now?  ;)
1288637318: <PipSqueek> 
1288637406: <hoamchan> so that's why street view was harvesting ssids and macs though eh?  they use your wifis to see what ssids and mac accresses you can see and compare it against their streetview snarfed database
1288637406: <PipSqueek> 
1288637557: <]3d0g> don't even need mac. Goog just geo-locates SSIDs. 
1288637557: <PipSqueek> 
1288637578: <hoamchan> macs would be a lot more static
1288637578: <PipSqueek> 
1288637582: <hoamchan> ssids can change
1288637582: <PipSqueek> 
1288637611: <]3d0g> mac of what, the AP?
1288637611: <PipSqueek> 
1288637613: <hoamchan> i'm still not sure i like how accurate it is however they do it
1288637613: <PipSqueek> 
1288637615: <hoamchan> yah
1288637615: <PipSqueek> 
1288637737: <]3d0g> goog takes both as parameters in the API.

1288710659: <PipSqueek>

1288713010: <PipSqueek> 
1288713017: <TeleCon> I feel your pain though.
1288713017: <PipSqueek> 
1288713035: <acr0nym> Heh, for which part?
1288713035: <PipSqueek> 
1288713041: <TeleCon> .*
1288713041: <PipSqueek> 
1288713044: <acr0nym> Heh.
1288713044: <PipSqueek> 
1288713246: <acr0nym> I REALLY shoulda stayed in bed today, I think.
1288713246: <PipSqueek> 
1288713272: <TeleCon> Did you vote?
1288713272: <PipSqueek> 
1288713279: <acr0nym> Yeah, like, last Wednesday.
1288713279: <PipSqueek> 
1288713283: <TeleCon> K
1288713283: <PipSqueek> 
1288713309: <tinfoil> If I hear someone else ask about voting status, violence will ensue
1288713310: <PipSqueek> 
1288713319: <acr0nym> Why, did you vote?
1288713319: <PipSqueek> 
1288713337: <acr0nym> Hah!  Ensue away!  You're 2000 miles away!
1288713337: <PipSqueek> 
1288713368: <acr0nym> Oh, well, 1300.  Almost as good.
1288713368: <PipSqueek> 
1288713371: <tinfoil> I received 6 email reminders, about a dozen twitter updates, even a friend sending out google invites
1288713371: <PipSqueek> 
1288713384: <TeleCon> lol
1288713384: <PipSqueek> 
1288713404: <acr0nym> Woot!  If I go through SF first, it's just over 2000 miles!  Heh.
1288713404: <PipSqueek> 
1288713430: <TeleCon> OBW, fuck a bunch of unity and e16
1288713430: <PipSqueek> 
1288713431: <acr0nym> Yeah, though, I cannot WAIT until I can safely assume that if I see a missed call on my home phone, that it's actually for me.
1288713431: <PipSqueek> 
1288713523: <fbx> oi
1288713523: <PipSqueek> 
1288713561: <acr0nym> Hey, fbx, did YOU vote!?
1288713561: <PipSqueek> 
1288713569: <acr0nym> tinfoil: Hey, are you still employed?
1288713569: <PipSqueek> 
1288713590: <TeleCon> I am so sick of political commercials and robo calls.
1288713590: <PipSqueek> 
1288713597: <acr0nym> Seriously.
1288713597: <PipSqueek> 
1288713607: <acr0nym> I thought about unplugging my whole phone system for awhile.
1288713607: <PipSqueek> 
1288713641: <fbx> acr0nym: yes, as i always do
1288713641: <PipSqueek> 
1288713652: <acr0nym> Really, I'm just trying for violence in Seattle.
1288713652: <PipSqueek> 
1288713653: <acr0nym> ;)
1288713653: <PipSqueek> 
1288713659: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: You?  Did YOU vote?
1288713659: <PipSqueek> 
1288713662: <fbx> can't say there was much to vote for in our district, and certainly not nationally
1288713662: <PipSqueek> 
1288713670: <fbx> we have cantor as a rep
1288713670: <PipSqueek> 
1288713690: <fbx> his district looks like the wikipedia entry on gerrymanders
1288713690: <PipSqueek> 
1288713704: <fbx> that shit just pisses me off
1288713704: <PipSqueek> 
1288713800: * ]3d0g voted a couple weeks ago
1288713814: <dp30> TeleCon: what's your problem with e16?
1288713814: <PipSqueek> 
1288713818: <dp30> I have not voted
1288713818: <PipSqueek> 
1288713827: <fbx> i like the thrill of using our proprietary closed system machines, ]3d0g 
1288713827: <PipSqueek> 
1288713946: <TeleCon> cut and paste don't work right anymore.
1288713946: <PipSqueek> 
1288713954: <TeleCon> And, gnome works fine for me, no reason to change.
1288713954: <PipSqueek> 
1288713960: <TeleCon> Way more effort than it's worth.
1288713960: <PipSqueek> 
1288713969: <dp30> heh
1288713969: <PipSqueek> 
1288714085: <]3d0g> fucking Avaya IP Polycoms are the most arcane things on the planet.
1288714085: <PipSqueek> 
1288714392: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: ]3d0g)

1288714886: <PipSqueek> 
1288714890: <acr0nym> -------->8--------
1288714890: <PipSqueek> 
1288714891: <acr0nym> Thanks for your email, I would like to discuss it over the phone or can I meet you? As there are lots of details. But in case this case is still being shuffled around. I believe I had an open relay, I did some things to stop it, and it seems to be closed, but I still see some mail going through and would like to discuss sendmail with someone.
1288714891: <PipSqueek> 
1288714896: <acr0nym> -------->8--------
1288714896: <PipSqueek> 
1288714907: <acr0nym> JUST TELL ME WHAT THE FUCK THE SERVER IS FOR, DOUCHE!
1288714907: <PipSqueek> 
1288714921: <tinfoil> Students....
1288714921: <PipSqueek> 
1288714961: <TeleCon> he's a student, right.
1288714961: <PipSqueek> 
1288714967: <TeleCon> Not supposed to be running servers?
1288714967: <PipSqueek> 
1288714987: <acr0nym> Well, it gets awfully damn grey around here, dammit.
1288714987: <PipSqueek> 
1288715007: <tinfoil> Dammit, wordpress is annoying me
1288715007: <PipSqueek> 
1288715018: <TeleCon> Not supposed to get support for running servers, I mean.
1288715018: <PipSqueek> 
1288715019: <tinfoil> First of all, it shouldn't be truncating posts according to my settings
1288715019: <PipSqueek> 
1288715023: <TeleCon> Send him to unix ops/
1288715023: <PipSqueek> 
1288715030: <tinfoil> second of all, it's even stripping <img> tags from posts
1288715030: <PipSqueek> 
1288715064: <acr0nym> TeleCon: Unfortunately, for cases like this, I am Unixops.
1288715064: <PipSqueek> 
1288715070: <tinfoil> (in feeds)
1288715070: <PipSqueek> 
1288715078: <TeleCon> yuck
1288715078: <PipSqueek> 
1288715153: <acr0nym> Even better, I'm wildly skeptical that there are "lots" of details.  I'm betting, umm, 3 details, tops.
1288715153: <PipSqueek> 
1288715330: <TeleCon> good luck
1288715330: <PipSqueek> 
1288715626: <tinfoil> Treat him like a terrorist informant looking for leniency - Torture him until he proves his loyalty and gives you all the details he promised.  If the details are inaccurate or he fabricates them, continue to torture him until he delivers.
1288715626: <PipSqueek> 
1288715635: <tinfoil> That
1288715635: <PipSqueek> 
1288715639: <tinfoil> 'll teach him.  :-)
1288715639: <PipSqueek> 
1288715766: <fbx> no, the rule should be simple: if you're too stupid to keep from setting up an open relay on your mail server, you shouldn't have a mail server
1288715766: <PipSqueek> 
1288716021: <fbx> nice topic, by the way
1288716021: <PipSqueek> 
1288716062: <fbx> so let's see
1288716062: <PipSqueek> 
1288716080: <fbx> us population is 307,006,550
1288716080: <PipSqueek> 
1288716108: <fbx> with 435 reps, that's each rep...representing 705,762 folks
1288716108: <PipSqueek> 
1288716115: <fbx> on average
1288716115: <PipSqueek> 
1288716231: <fbx> so let's consider a 3D map of the US, with the height of an area being determined by population "tent poles" built on the most populated local government unit (city, town, county, etc)
1288716231: <PipSqueek> 
1288716258: <fbx> so if we raise the poles, at some point, the tents overlap from various cities, towns, counties, etc
1288716258: <PipSqueek> 
1288716281: <fbx> at those overlap points, given local entity boundaries, we cut congressional districts up
1288716281: <PipSqueek> 
1288716299: <fbx> in other words, we never carve up counties or cities
1288716299: <PipSqueek> 
1288716328: <fbx> but the city belongs to the highest "tent pole" in the area, for instance
1288716328: <PipSqueek> 
1288716330: <fbx> thoughts?
1288716330: <PipSqueek> 
1288716365: <fbx> and we're looking for each area to represent roughly the common average of 705k per rep
1288716365: <PipSqueek> 
1288716446: <fbx> or we lower the average to, say, 500k and get more reps in there
1288716446: <PipSqueek> 
1288716467: <fbx> personally, i think being one voice amongst 500k is pretty bad
1288716467: <PipSqueek> 
1288716545: <fbx> i mean, 435 has been the number since 1911
1288716545: <PipSqueek> 
1288716551: <fbx> that's ridiculous
1288716551: <PipSqueek> 
1288717076: * fbx hears many crickets
1288717116: <tinfoil> I was going to give you my soap box so you could stand a little higher
1288717116: <PipSqueek> 
1288717140: <tinfoil> What we need is a pyramid structure
1288717140: <PipSqueek> 
1288717172: <tinfoil> So we recruit people who follow our beliefs, and represent them, and they recruit people who follow their beliefs, etc, etc
1288717172: <PipSqueek> 
1288717173: <fbx> well, that was the tent pole idea, only more rounded than a pyramid
1288717173: <PipSqueek> 
1288717184: <TeleCon> The system is so corrupt, that adding representatives would not matter.
1288717185: <PipSqueek> 
1288717185: <fbx> hrm
1288717186: <PipSqueek> 
1288717196: <fbx> i meant in geographical area, tinfoil 
1288717196: <PipSqueek> 
1288717197: * tinfoil was being sarcastic
1288717202: <fbx> yeah
1288717202: <PipSqueek> 
1288717204: <fbx> i got it
1288717204: <PipSqueek> 
1288717223: <fbx> TeleCon: there are 3 things that might make it better
1288717223: <PipSqueek> 
1288717231: <fbx> 1) reapportionment
1288717231: <PipSqueek> 
1288717241: <fbx> 2) vote validation
1288717241: <PipSqueek> 
1288717248: <tinfoil> Viva la Revolution!
1288717248: <PipSqueek> 
1288717272: <fbx> 3) doing something with the money...not quite sure what, but i'm neither for citizens united nor completely for federal funding for elections
1288717272: <PipSqueek> 
1288717304: <fbx> this is just #1 i'm talking about here
1288717304: <PipSqueek> 
1288717314: <fbx> and the constitution's number per rep? 30,000
1288717314: <PipSqueek> 
1288717332: <tinfoil> We need to dispand the government and let corporations run everything
1288717332: <PipSqueek> 
1288717338: <fbx> we're 23x the constitutional numbers right now
1288717338: <PipSqueek> 
1288717344: <tinfoil> At least then it would be accurate
1288717344: <PipSqueek> 
1288717371: <fbx> tinfoil: yeah, so then when someone upstream poisons my well water, i'll get my due in court!
1288717371: <PipSqueek> 
1288717399: <fbx> unless they run that court...
1288717399: <PipSqueek> 
1288717402: <fbx> *sigh*
1288717402: <PipSqueek> 
1288717483: <fbx> TeleCon: with more reps, it might be more expensive to buy a congress
1288717483: <PipSqueek> 
1288717634: --> ]3d0g (jkarp@6988929A.F4AE6A51.BF63E968.IP) has joined #lobby

1288717879: <PipSqueek> 
1288717887: <fbx> i was talking about how your representative represents you and 705,000 other individuals
1288717887: <PipSqueek> 
1288717903: <]3d0g> which one?
1288717903: <PipSqueek> 
1288717910: <fbx> and how the constitution only states the lower limit as 30,000 per rep
1288717910: <PipSqueek> 
1288717912: <fbx> house of reps
1288717912: <PipSqueek> 
1288717921: <fbx> congresscritter
1288717922: <PipSqueek> 
1288717938: <]3d0g> as long as he/she can be bought, all is good.
1288717938: <PipSqueek> 
1288717959: <fbx> not a big believer in the process of governing, are we?

1288717990: <PipSqueek> 
1288717993: <]3d0g> bah. we've got the best our money can buy.
1288717993: <PipSqueek> 
1288718014: <fbx> hah. i doubt seriously it's YOUR money buying them, dude
1288718014: <PipSqueek>

1288718152: <TeleCon> acr0nym: I like google listen for that.
1288718152: <PipSqueek> 
1288718152: <PipSqueek> 
1288718173: <]3d0g> just keep convincing yourself of that fbx
1288718173: <PipSqueek> 
1288718177: * ]3d0g nods
1288718189: <acr0nym> WTF is google listen?
1288718189: <PipSqueek> 
1288718190: * tinfoil throws gasoline onto the fire
1288718203: <fbx> ok, do tell if your story is different, ]3d0g 
1288718203: <PipSqueek> 
1288718204: <acr0nym> Ah.
1288718204: <PipSqueek> 
1288718208: <ouiji> someone write me a script to pull etc/shadow files from a list of servers, or better yet just an example shell of a script that gives an example of how to login via ssh, issuea command, and capture the output.. my attempt is suck
1288718209: <PipSqueek> 
1288718209: <]3d0g> listen is goog's podcatcher that's married to reader.
1288718209: <PipSqueek> 
1288718216: <acr0nym> Yeah, that'd be useful, if I EVER LISTENED TO PODCASTS ON MY PHONE.
1288718216: <PipSqueek>

1288718218: <PipSqueek>

1288718226: <PipSqueek> 
1288718241: <acr0nym> tinfoil: I have an iMac with a 1TB drive on my desk, doing very little else.
1288718241: <PipSqueek> 
1288718250: <acr0nym> Why not give it SOMETHING to do?
1288718250: <PipSqueek> 
1288718257: <tinfoil> acr0nym: Install linux on it.  ;-)
1288718257: <PipSqueek> 
1288718285: <TeleCon> I listen to podcasts in the car, so listen works really well.
1288718285: <PipSqueek> 
1288718286: <acr0nym> That would pretty much invalidate my using it as an OS X server.  To support OS X servers.
1288718286: <PipSqueek>

1288718499: <TeleCon> no
1288718499: <PipSqueek> 
1288718546: <hoamchan> isn't google listen that thing where you can google just about anything and hear a 30 second sample?  it used to be full songs before google bought them
1288718546: <PipSqueek> 
1288718567: <tinfoil> I wish people had that option

1288718706: <PipSqueek> 
1288718902: <]3d0g> sounds quite exploitable.
1288718902: <PipSqueek> 
1288718954: <tinfoil> Hey, speaking of which - I need to get my hands on a couple sandvines so I can give them to people to reverse engineer and find remote exploits/DOS for.  :-)
1288718954: <PipSqueek> 
1288718960: <hoamchan> good target for it too.  full command execution capability on destination systems

1288718985: <ouiji> =(
1288718985: <PipSqueek> 
1288718997: <tinfoil> hoamchan: We've used that as a remote hand-of-god 
1288718997: <PipSqueek> 
1288719023: <tinfoil> The best part is, if done right, there's no tracable logs
1288719023: <PipSqueek> 
1288719052: <hoamchan> handjob of god for the emmaculate erruption?
1288719052: <PipSqueek> 
1288719083: <tinfoil> You got it.
1288719083: <PipSqueek> 
1288719103: <hoamchan> did they ever update ttysnoop for ptys?
1288719103: <PipSqueek> 
1288719109: <hoamchan> now there was an awesome handjobber
1288719109: <PipSqueek> 
1288719307: <ouiji> ah, thats the problem
1288719307: <PipSqueek> 
1288719377: <fbx> how about sooper$ecret123?
1288719377: <PipSqueek> 
1288720522: <hoamchan> hmm. boodler and mkpwd are the only things i compile from source anymore on my standard desktops
1288720522: <PipSqueek> 
1288720695: <tinfoil> Question is, are you doing less on your desktop or is everything you've been using already compiled the way you like it
1288720695: <PipSqueek> 
1288720730: <ouiji> dan-desktop: Sending command: sudo cat /etc/shadow    dan-desktop: Requesting service exec on channel 1.  dan-desktop: channel 1: open confirm rwindow 0 rmax 32768 dan-desktop: input_channel_request: rtype exit-status reply 0  dan-desktop: channel 1: rcvd eof   dan-desktop: channel 1: output open -> drain   dan-desktop: channel 1: rcvd close   
1288720730: <PipSqueek> 
1288720855: <hoamchan> everything that i used to have to compile myself is now available in repos
1288720855: <PipSqueek> 
1288720866: <hoamchan> oh wait.  darkice and icecast
1288720866: <PipSqueek> 
1288720911: <hoamchan> er not icecast.  darkice is available in repos but stripped of encumbered methods - mp3
1288720911: <PipSqueek> 
1288720926: <hoamchan> boodler and mkpwd arent in rebos at all
1288720926: <PipSqueek> 
1288721275: <hoamchan> and if you're wondering why boodler is so important: think noisy hotels
1288721279: <PipSqueek> 
1288721284: <hoamchan>  boodler.py -o pulse com.eblong.ow.storm/HeavyRain

1288721653: <tinfoil> Oh, I see America won the World Series, again.
1288721653: <PipSqueek> 
1288721804: <hoamchan> have they ever not?  canadian team ever won?
1288721804: <PipSqueek> 
1288721814: <tinfoil> 2 years in a row
1288721814: <PipSqueek> 
1288721842: <tinfoil> Still have yet to see any teams from other than North America win the World Series, though
1288721842: <PipSqueek> 
1288721848: <tinfoil> or even participate
1288721848: <PipSqueek> 
1288721920: <hoamchan> they should get japan and south america. carribbean in at least
1288721920: <PipSqueek> 
1288721931: <hoamchan> they'd prolly kick our overpaid asses though
1288721931: <PipSqueek> 
1288721944: <tinfoil> Hah
1288721944: <PipSqueek> 
1288722266: <tinfoil> One thing that never made sense to me is rioting when you home team wins a sporting event
1288722268: <PipSqueek> 
1288722279: <tinfoil> "Yeah, we won, lets destroy our neighborhood!"
1288722280: <PipSqueek> 
1288722311: <tinfoil> Then again, it would help if I understood rioting for anything other than extreme political reasons.
1288722311: <PipSqueek>

1288723369: <PipSqueek>

1288730658: * tinfoil being a smart ass, it took me about a week to get it working with expect
1288730680: <tinfoil> then I learned how to deposit my keys on every box I had access too, use ssh-agent
1288730680: <PipSqueek> 
1288730735: <dp30> oh, did I say that out loud? :P

1288730746: <PipSqueek> 
1288730799: <tinfoil> I hope so, it was developed on them
1288730799: <PipSqueek> 
1288730811: <tinfoil> expect is part of the tcl project, IIRC
1288730811: <PipSqueek> 
1288730813: <dp30> didn't know. not actually used expect before

1288730937: <PipSqueek> 
1288731151: <tinfoil> expect is handy, if someone had it on their resume it would add as a point in their favor, but isn't nearly a make or break
1288731151: <PipSqueek> 
1288732232: <ouiji> dp30: Ive got Net::SSH::Perl working, it will log in, but when I try and get the file, it just gives me:

1288804419: <tinfoil> until...?
1288804419: <PipSqueek> 
1288804423: <tinfoil> The world ends?
1288804423: <PipSqueek> 
1288804425: <tinfoil> You take a shit?
1288804425: <PipSqueek> 
1288804498: <tinfoil> Lindsey Lohan gets her second DUI for the day?
1288804498: <PipSqueek> 
1288804658: <hoamchan> disney is pretty good at churning out malfunctioning adults huh
1288804658: <PipSqueek> 
1288804663: <hoamchan> they should get sued for child abuse
1288804663: <PipSqueek> 
1288804691: <hoamchan> woot.  newest nuvi ordered
1288804691: <PipSqueek> 
1288804812: <tinfoil> I suspect that not even MS would attempt to take on Disney
1288804812: <PipSqueek> 
1288804822: <tinfoil> Let alone DoJ
1288804822: <PipSqueek> 
1288804831: <hoamchan> comcast tried
1288804831: <PipSqueek> 
1288804839: <hoamchan> got spanked for the attempt
1288804839: <PipSqueek> 
1288804851: <hoamchan> so now they're swallowing up nbc
1288804851: <PipSqueek> 
1288805442: <dp30> hoamchan: nuvi?
1288805442: <PipSqueek> 
1288805445: <dp30> GPS?
1288805445: <PipSqueek> 
1288805447: <hoamchan> garmin gps
1288805447: <PipSqueek> 
1288805454: <dp30> what're you doing with the old one?
1288805454: <PipSqueek> 
1288805468: <hoamchan> my oldest one is still completely functional
1288805468: <PipSqueek> 
1288805483: <hoamchan> nuvi 350 NA
1288805483: <PipSqueek> 
1288805490: <hoamchan> my 760T blew up
1288805490: <PipSqueek> 
1288805501: <dp30> how does a gps blow up?
1288805501: <PipSqueek> 
1288805502: <hoamchan> it was in the second round of battery related recalls
1288805502: <PipSqueek> 
1288805520: <hoamchan> battery fizzled out and created a hazmat emergency
1288805520: <PipSqueek> 
1288805523: <dp30> ah
1288805523: <PipSqueek> 
1288805524: <dp30> nice
1288805524: <PipSqueek> 
1288805534: <hoamchan> happened in the parking lot of the airport
1288805534: <PipSqueek> 
1288805546: <hoamchan> right when i was parking the rental car
1288805546: <PipSqueek> 
1288805554: <hoamchan> it got me home.  i'll give it credit for that much
1288805554: <PipSqueek> 
1288805591: <hoamchan> in a lot of respects the 350 was better than the 760.  less features but way less interface lag
1288805591: <PipSqueek> 
1288805643: <tinfoil> I hope garmin adopts the touchscreens like modern celphons
1288805643: <PipSqueek> 
1288805662: <tinfoil> I love my garmin in terms of feature focus and effectivness, but using it sucks
1288805662: <PipSqueek> 
1288805747: <hoamchan> https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=134&pID=87930

1288805747: <hoamchan>  multi-touch glass display
1288805747: <PipSqueek> 
1288805756: <tinfoil> oh, nice!
1288805756: <PipSqueek> 
1288806217: <hoamchan> the 350 cost 900$ when i first got it.  the fact that it's still completely usable makes me feel a lot less pissed off about that
1288806217: <PipSqueek> 
1288806233: <hoamchan> that was January 2006
1288806233: <PipSqueek> 
1288807601: <TeleCon> I like using my n1 as gps.
1288807601: <PipSqueek> 
1288807818: <hoamchan> you have the car dock?
1288807818: <PipSqueek> 
1288807885: <]3d0g> G2 must have a deal with the GPS devil. It locks faster than goog maps can paint the screen.
1288807885: <PipSqueek> 
1288808092: <dp30>  hrm. I need some way to control my desk fan from my computer
1288808092: <PipSqueek> 
1288808137: <tinfoil> dp30: Get a more ergonomic desk.  ;-)
1288808137: <PipSqueek> 
1288808191: <TeleCon> hoamchan: Yes.
1288808191: <PipSqueek> 
1288808200: <TeleCon> It has some issues, but I really like it.
1288808200: <PipSqueek> 
1288808396: <]3d0g> this dp30: http://www.pwrusb.com
1288808396: <PipSqueek> 
1288808551: <dp30> tinfoil: it's not the ergonomics. it's just not big enough
1288808551: <PipSqueek> 
1288808582: <dp30> ]3d0g: is that just a regular power switch, with a usb controller in it?
1288808582: <PipSqueek> 
1288808588: <dp30> if so, that's fucking *cool*
1288808588: <PipSqueek> 
1288808630: <]3d0g> Indeed. I'm a buyin' as soon as they come out.
1288808630: <PipSqueek> 
1288808642: <tinfoil> I loved running a datacenter with remote-controlled power strips
1288808642: <PipSqueek> 
1288808649: <tinfoil> especially when they could be SNMP managed
1288808649: <PipSqueek> 
1288808670: <tinfoil> RRD graphs for individual socket status, power draw, and temp
1288808670: <PipSqueek> 
1288808764: <dp30> ]3d0g: agreed
1288808764: <PipSqueek> 
1288809698: <ouiji> hey dp30, you ever get a chance to take a look at http://pastebin.com/T3xBLeJx   ?
1288809698: <PipSqueek> 
1288809838: <tinfoil> dp30: Aside from Google analytics, what do you use to analyze web traffic these days?  (specifically access logs)
1288809838: <PipSqueek> 
1288812721: <TeleCon> I was using awstats for a long time.
1288812721: <PipSqueek> 
1288812731: <TeleCon> Cron job broke though.

1288813730: <acr0nym> Heh.
1288813730: <PipSqueek> 
1288813731: <]3d0g> heh
1288813731: <PipSqueek> 
1288813881: <acr0nym> I should totally buy this shirt: http://www.tshirthell.com/funny-shirts/uncle-with-benefits/  Creep out TeleCon, AND all his friends.
1288813881: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/84hF (T-Shirt Hell :: Shirts :: UNCLE WITH BENEFITS)
1288813996: <TeleCon> acr0nym: True
1288813996: <PipSqueek> 
1288814098: <acr0nym> Heh, also good: http://www.tshirthell.com/funny-shirts-stock/coma-sutra/
1288814098: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/84hM (T-Shirt Hell :: Shirts :: COMA SUTRA)
1288814764: <TeleCon> acr0nym: i think the cron job went away before the other.
1288814764: <PipSqueek> 
1288814771: <acr0nym> Heh, mebbe.
1288814771: <PipSqueek> 
1288815242: <hoamchan> why would that creep out TC?
1288815243: <PipSqueek> 
1288815252: <hoamchan> oh wait is that your for real brother?
1288815252: <PipSqueek> 
1288815260: <acr0nym> He's my brother?  My nieces are his daughters?
1288815260: <PipSqueek> 
1288815268: <acr0nym> Oh, heh, yeah, you didn't know that?
1288815268: <PipSqueek> 
1288815271: <hoamchan> yah.  definite creep out
1288815271: <PipSqueek> 
1288815273: <hoamchan> i did but forgot
1288815273: <PipSqueek> 
1288815294: <hoamchan> would be funnier once the nieces are > 16 
1288815294: <PipSqueek> 
1288815356: <TeleCon> I could see that shirt ending up with holes in it though.
1288815356: <PipSqueek> 
1288815379: <acr0nym> About 9mm in diameter?
1288815379: <PipSqueek> 
1288815495: <hoamchan> i'd think it would be even funnier still if TC only had sons
1288815495: <PipSqueek> 
1288815502: <acr0nym> Heh, no doubt.
1288815502: <PipSqueek> 
1288815535: <TeleCon> no, not 9mm
1288815535: <PipSqueek> 
1288815541: <TeleCon> I don't own a 9.
1288815541: <PipSqueek> 
1288815546: <acr0nym> Okay, whatever the hell you're carrying these days.
1288815546: <PipSqueek> 
1288815555: <acr0nym> Oh, right, you sold me at least one of your 9mm's.
1288815555: <PipSqueek> 
1288815572: <TeleCon> Only if I thought you were serious.
1288815572: <PipSqueek> 
1288815587: <]3d0g> so what's under TC's coat these days?
1288815587: <PipSqueek> 
1288815600: <acr0nym> Still got that damn pimp gun?  Heh.
1288815600: <PipSqueek> 
1288816176: <TeleCon> HKUSP in .45
1288816176: <PipSqueek> 
1288816290: <hoamchan> crazy.  i can't get an open carry permit unless i'm making night deposits in excess of 10k cash or a member of law enforcement
1288816290: <PipSqueek> 
1288816303: <hoamchan> and theres zero chance of getting a concealed carry permit
1288816303: <PipSqueek> 
1288816333: <hoamchan> can own em, can transport them disassembled, can fire em at ranges, can't carry em
1288816333: <PipSqueek> 
1288816340: <hoamchan> handguns at least
1288816340: <PipSqueek> 
1288817307: <fbx> get a rifle and carry it in plain view
1288817307: <PipSqueek> 
1288817312: <fbx> no need to conceal
1288817312: <PipSqueek> 
1288817324: <fbx> it's a huge "don't fuck with me" sign, right in your hands
1288817324: <PipSqueek> 
1288817394: <hoamchan> perfectly legal even in nj but would probably get you a cop rolling 2 mph along side you as you walk
1288817394: <PipSqueek> 
1288817618: <fbx> oh, no problem...that's just more protection, right?
1288817618: <PipSqueek> 
1288817763: <fbx> TeleCon: your cow kicks ass
1288817763: <PipSqueek> 
1288818393: <tinfoil> 23 of 80 IT Ops people get the axe in the next 24 hours
1288818393: <PipSqueek> 
1288818419: <acr0nym> Yowch.  How 'bout you?
1288818419: <PipSqueek> 
1288818446: <tinfoil> Will know within the next 24 hours.  Manager made it clear that we're not excepted
1288818446: <PipSqueek> 
1288818488: <dp30> ugh
1288818488: <PipSqueek> 
1288818497: <tinfoil> I think it's like 400ish FTE's total
1288818497: <PipSqueek> 
1288818497: <dp30> running around here like a fucking chuicken with my head cut off
1288818497: <PipSqueek> 
1288818533: <dp30> ok, wtf is up with google docs?
1288818533: <PipSqueek> 
1288818605: <acr0nym> Well, Google Docs is this thing that Google is doing to compete with Microsoft Office.
1288818605: <PipSqueek> 
1288818610: <acr0nym> It lets you edit all kinds of documents online.
1288818610: <PipSqueek> 
1288818648: <hoamchan> oO
1288818648: <PipSqueek> 
1288818751: <hoamchan> does folding have a native GPU client for linux yet
1288818751: <PipSqueek> 
1288818881: <hoamchan> hmm looks like no
1288818881: <PipSqueek> 
1288818889: <hoamchan> wine is a possibility
1288818889: <PipSqueek> 
1288819556: <tinfoil> This may sound silly, but I knida hate knowing it's coming
1288819556: <PipSqueek> 
1288819565: <tinfoil> Rather just get this over with.
1288819565: <PipSqueek> 
1288819582: <tinfoil> Today, not tomorrow
1288819582: <PipSqueek> 
1288819595: <tinfoil> Coming to work tomorrow will suck
1288819595: <PipSqueek> 
1288819834: <acr0nym> Yeah, no doubt.
1288819834: <PipSqueek> 
1288820186: <tinfoil> The other suckie thing is losing my internet access.
1288820186: <PipSqueek> 
1288820191: <tinfoil> Wonder how long it will take for them to cancel it
1288820191: <PipSqueek> 
1288820319: <tinfoil> We were guessing the total cut of FTE+Contractors is closer to 20% of overall workforce
1288820319: <PipSqueek> 
1288820335: <tinfoil> It will be official in 24 hours
1288820335: <PipSqueek> 
1288820342: <tinfoil> at the latest
1288820342: <PipSqueek> 
1288820500: <hoamchan> are you cheap?
1288820500: <PipSqueek> 
1288820513: <hoamchan> cheap + essential = safe
1288820513: <PipSqueek> 
1288820541: <tinfoil> Out of our group, I'm the 1st pick to go, IMHO
1288820541: <PipSqueek> 
1288820552: <tinfoil> Most of my work was given to other teams in the last 2 months
1288820552: <PipSqueek> 
1288820574: <tinfoil> Also, not married
1288820574: <PipSqueek> 
1288820584: <tinfoil> no kids
1288820584: <PipSqueek> 
1288820608: <tinfoil> Everyone else is valuable
1288820608: <PipSqueek> 
1288821012: <hoamchan> you got to be fucking kidding me.  i'd sack married with kids first
1288821012: <PipSqueek> 
1288821020: <hoamchan> insurance costs are way fucking higher for them
1288821020: <PipSqueek> 
1288821050: <hoamchan> also, i've never seen a single person steal with the justification of "i have a family to feed"
1288821050: <PipSqueek> 
1288821062: <hoamchan> packing up
1288821062: <PipSqueek> 
1288821078: <tinfoil> You've seen someone do that for real?
1288821078: <PipSqueek> 
1288821098: <tinfoil> Also, I wouldn't use that excuse - I just want stuff.  ;-)
1288821098: <PipSqueek> 
1288821394: <tinfoil> You know....
1288821394: <PipSqueek> 
1288821408: <tinfoil> Lets say a wireless ISP was going to put themselves in a position to be sold
1288821408: <PipSqueek> 
1288821435: <tinfoil> and they wanted to make it look like their network had room to scale, when it might actually not
1288821435: <PipSqueek> 
1288821472: <tinfoil> implementing sandvines to throttle down users who went above a specific cap would have several benefits
1288821472: <PipSqueek> 
1288821486: <tinfoil> one - it keeps network usage down
1288821486: <PipSqueek> 
1288821499: <tinfoil> but it makes for speedy networks as long as you stay below a specific cap
1288821499: <PipSqueek> 
1288821505: <tinfoil> (perfect for demonstrating to execs)
1288821505: <PipSqueek> 
1288821527: <tinfoil> blame complaints on poor performance to poor reception which is being addressed in the buildout
1288821527: <PipSqueek> 
1288822756: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
1288824747: <tinfoil> Out compliance guy jokingly found a loophole in compliance user/password policies
1288824747: <PipSqueek> 
1288824814: <tinfoil> there's nothing saying users can't use the same password.  :-)
1288824814: <PipSqueek>

1288881146: <PipSqueek> 
1288881171: <fbx> in fact, the best news out of this election? the fucking blue dog dems (read Pub Lites) were decimated
1288881171: <PipSqueek> 
1288881180: <fbx> they thought staying right was the best course of action

1288881195: <]3d0g> where's tinfoil working these days?
1288881195: <PipSqueek> 
1288881200: <fbx> few principles in that group
1288881200: <PipSqueek> 
1288881204: <hoamchan> they've got a new corporate right coalition forming in secret though
1288881204: <PipSqueek> 
1288881212: <hoamchan> lemme see if i can dig up the name
1288881212: <PipSqueek> 
1288881213: <fbx> no doubt
1288881213: <PipSqueek> 
1288881230: <fbx> so another group can do the same and get blasted next election
1288881230: <PipSqueek> 
1288881244: <hoamchan> that's why they're staying "secret"
1288881244: <PipSqueek> 
1288881257: <hoamchan> secret as in not blathering bayah style to the press
1288881257: <PipSqueek> 
1288881258: <fbx> face it: either government can be a solution (in some cases), or it's never the solution
1288881258: <PipSqueek> 
1288881278: <hoamchan> but every blog knows about them.  which means low information voters (everyone really) won't
1288881278: <PipSqueek> 
1288881280: <fbx> saying you're a dem and believing the latter always is unprincipled, to me

1288881347: <PipSqueek> 
1288881364: <fbx> all you're asking for there is a shade of mccarthyism and clinton-like investigations of obama
1288881364: <PipSqueek> 
1288881407: <hoamchan> fed went off the reservation though
1288881407: <PipSqueek> 
1288881426: <fbx> bit of a waste of taxpayer money there, if we're going to be forgiving and forgetting over iraq and a few other bush era imbroglios
1288881426: <PipSqueek> 
1288881436: <hoamchan> they're seriously trying to stave off deflation which is what the corps want as they're sitting on ginormous scads of cash
1288881436: <PipSqueek> 
1288881443: <fbx> imbroglio
1288881443: <PipSqueek> 
1288881447: <fbx> what a great word
1288881447: <PipSqueek> 
1288881484: <fbx> yeah - i posted stiglitz WaPo response to QE2 this morning
1288881484: <PipSqueek> 
1288881494: <hoamchan> it's pretty simple.  tie up the house with bullshit investigations and suddenly DOJ starts criminal proceedings against the previous administration
1288881494: <PipSqueek> 
1288881515: <fbx> he's spot on, and Bernanke isn't, imnsho
1288881515: <hoamchan> if obama had balls he'd let slip that safety is bidirectional
1288881515: <PipSqueek> 
1288881515: <PipSqueek> 
1288881546: <fbx> i don't even like that form of deal, hoamchan 
1288881546: <PipSqueek> 
1288881557: <fbx> govern and quit playing fucking games
1288881557: <PipSqueek> 
1288881574: <fbx> but what the fuck do i know, eh?

1288881612: <fbx> who has exactly one more nobel prize for economics than bernanke
1288881612: <PipSqueek> 
1288881668: <hoamchan> so... i read a little while ago that there's a bond bubble
1288881668: <PipSqueek> 
1288881676: <hoamchan> and now the fed's buying up bonds?
1288881676: <PipSqueek> 
1288881677: <fbx> hehe
1288881677: <PipSqueek> 
1288881685: <hoamchan> did they suddenly become toxic but that didn't make the news?
1288881685: <PipSqueek> 
1288881689: <fbx> no
1288881689: <PipSqueek> 
1288881714: <fbx> money from that article:
1288881714: <PipSqueek> 
1288881719: <fbx> and sorry for the big paste
1288881719: <PipSqueek> 
1288881721: <fbx> The Fed, and the Fed's advocates, are falling into the same trap that led us into the crisis in the first place. Their view is that the major lever for economic policy is the interest rate and if we just get it right, we can steer this. That didn't work. It forgot about financial fragility and how the banking system operates. They're thinking the interest rate is a dial you can set and by setting that dial, you can regulate the economy. In fact, it operates primaril
1288881721: <PipSqueek> 
1288881757: <hoamchan> er that's why they've gone off the reservation and started buying bonds
1288881757: <PipSqueek> 
1288881790: <fbx> hell, that whole article is short and damn good
1288881790: <PipSqueek> 
1288881791: <hoamchan> they can't drop rates any lower i don't think
1288881791: <PipSqueek> 
1288881815: <fbx> well, they say they're trying to steer with interest rates
1288881815: <PipSqueek> 
1288881828: <hoamchan> http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/business/stories/2010/11/04/displeased-fed-to-buy-600billion-in-bonds.html?sid=101

1288881828: <fbx> and this is the way to do it
1288881828: <PipSqueek> 
1288881891: <hoamchan> they've exhausted the interest rate twiddling.  broke the rudder
1288881891: <PipSqueek> 
1288881896: <dp> blargh
1288881896: <PipSqueek> 
1288881903: <dp> we;'re getting ~2Mbps down
1288881903: <PipSqueek> 
1288881909: <dp> makes it difficult to work
1288881909: <PipSqueek> 
1288882011: <fbx> it's still as simple as it was before the first stimulus: in the absence of private industry creating jobs and investment that creates jobs, someone has to. the first lever is to make investment lower cost...but rates are low enough and cash sitting around plenty enough that the lever is hard over on that. the second is direct government job creation and/or indirect creation through tax policy
1288882011: <PipSqueek> 
1288882061: <fbx> in our case, we needed to go big and stay big on that, because until jobs are created and people start spending, companies will empty inventory and use cash for profiteering, not creating jobs
1288882061: <PipSqueek> 
1288882071: <hoamchan> high taxes actually spur r&d and job creation.  companies have far less incentive to hoard cash if they're going to get charged for it
1288882071: <PipSqueek> 
1288882084: <hoamchan> high corp taxes... that actually get paid i mean
1288882084: <PipSqueek> 
1288882091: <fbx> once consumption comes up, they'll go big. THEN the government needs to stop stimulus
1288882091: <PipSqueek> 
1288882131: <fbx> this has historical comparisons: the US in the early 1930s and japan in the 1990s
1288882131: <PipSqueek> 
1288882142: <fbx> BOTH should have had bigger stimulus for longer
1288882142: <PipSqueek> 
1288882144: <fbx> both didn't 
1288882144: <PipSqueek> 
1288882148: <fbx> both suffered
1288882148: <PipSqueek> 
1288882162: <fbx> longer and deeper recessions (and depressions)
1288882162: <PipSqueek> 
1288882249: <fbx> we're going to do the same fucking thing, because it's in the political interests of the larger echo chamber for the US to suffer for at least two if not four more years
1288882249: <PipSqueek> 
1288882285: <fbx> that's not governing
1288882285: <PipSqueek> 
1288882293: <fbx> it's politicking
1288882293: <PipSqueek> 
1288882296: <fbx> and it pisses me off
1288882296: <PipSqueek> 
1288882308: <hoamchan> time for a star chamber
1288882308: <PipSqueek> 
1288882341: <hoamchan> pick powerful and immune people off the streets, black bag em and try em and execute them in secret since the normal court process isn't up to it
1288882341: <PipSqueek> 
1288882363: <fbx> good luck with that. in january, we'll ensconce the best congress money could buy
1288882363: <PipSqueek> 
1288882371: <dp> time for people who aren't politicians to be in office
1288882371: <PipSqueek> 
1288882380: <hoamchan> like rand paul!
1288882380: <PipSqueek> 
1288882385: <dp> heh
1288882385: <PipSqueek> 
1288882387: <fbx> heh
1288882387: <PipSqueek> 
1288882389: <dp> <-- not a kentuckian
1288882389: <PipSqueek> 
1288882406: <hoamchan> if you know any, punch them in their purdy lips
1288882406: <PipSqueek> 
1288882434: <dp> meh. lesser of two evils there
1288882434: <PipSqueek> 
1288882459: <hoamchan> though really, i think it all comes down to the democrats learned how to survive as a minority party and get elected by not rocking the boat
1288882459: <PipSqueek> 
1288882602: <fbx> well, they certainly proved they need some lessons on defining a political narrative and repeating it over and over
1288882602: <PipSqueek> 
1288882620: <fbx> the more i see politics, the more i truly believe it's psyops
1288882620: <PipSqueek> 
1288882637: <fbx> craft a message with some logic, repeat it over and over
1288882637: <PipSqueek> 
1288882663: <fbx> then craft an overton window and drag it to your side by shifting the message and logic ever so slightly over time
1288882663: <PipSqueek> 
1288882669: <fbx> pubs are great at this
1288882669: <PipSqueek> 
1288882692: <fbx> how many times did you hear "what the Amurcan people want" yesterday from pubs?
1288882692: <PipSqueek> 
1288882737: <hoamchan> yes.  we want to not be able to visit the doctor or the hospital when we're unemployed 
1288882737: <PipSqueek> 
1288882743: <hoamchan> makes perfect sense to me
1288882743: <PipSqueek> 
1288882776: <fbx> the strangest part of that is healthcare costs are some of the biggest expenses for companies
1288882776: <PipSqueek> 
1288882796: <hoamchan> what's funny is the corporate puppetmasters are managing to pull france and even the netherlands right at an alarming pace
1288882796: <PipSqueek> 
1288882808: <fbx> you'd think they'd welcome being on a more level playing field with any foreign country that has a govt healthcare plan available
1288882808: <PipSqueek> 
1288882817: <hoamchan> it is and it isn't.  it's a cost they're willing to pay to keep people joblocked
1288882817: <PipSqueek> 
1288882841: <hoamchan> you won't quit your asshat job because you need health care for your family that ONLY the corporation you work for can provide
1288882841: <PipSqueek> 
1288882866: <fbx> yeah, so i guess "freedom" in the marketplace (of jobs) has nothing to do with the freedom they're talking about, eh?
1288882866: <PipSqueek> 
1288882887: <fbx> ok, how about this:
1288882887: <PipSqueek> 
1288882894: <hoamchan> you're free to go.  just don't get injured when the door hits you on the ass as you leave cos you can't afford the lawyers or the doctors
1288882894: <PipSqueek> 
1288882910: <fbx> 1) offer a decent public option
1288882910: <PipSqueek> 
1288882932: <fbx> 2) lower corporate tax rates (at least the list, maybe not the effective rates)
1288882932: <PipSqueek> 
1288882986: <hoamchan> you're thinking too small.  rico charges against criminal enterprises known as corporations that knowingly violate tax, employment, or election laws.  attack the corporate license/charter.  this is how you kill the parasite
1288882986: <PipSqueek> 
1288883038: <hoamchan> teddy roosevelt broke standard oil because they had the nerve to think they were bigger than the govt.  why do you think the corp puppets cry states rights (states are easier and smaller) and smaller govt?
1288883038: <PipSqueek> 
1288883104: <hoamchan> once you put the execs on notice that once their charter is gone, so is their personal liability shield and they WILL not collect their golden parachute, they will go to jail
1288883104: <PipSqueek> 
1288883139: <hoamchan> you'll then find people behave and keep the fuck out of politics and sanity will be restored somewhat because the corps will be too scared to flex too much muscle

1288883224: <PipSqueek> 
1288883319: <hoamchan> now that the elections are over, i'd have the DOJ, FBI and IRS sack every office of every 401c3 involved in this election.  before it would look too partisan
1288883319: <PipSqueek> 
1288883338: <hoamchan> now, "discover" their paperwork.... all of it
1288883338: <PipSqueek> 
1288883339: <hoamchan> and leak it
1288883339: <PipSqueek> 
1288883349: <hoamchan> who cares if you get a conviction
1288883349: <PipSqueek> 
1288883621: <hoamchan> especially any emails or paperwork describing the tea party as rubes.  you know some asshat like koch has put it in writing.  start a wingnut civil war

1288886710: <tinfoil> Today is the day...
1288886710: <PipSqueek> 
1288886976: <]3d0g> you don't know yet/
1288886976: <PipSqueek> 
1288886977: <]3d0g> ?
1288886977: <PipSqueek> 
1288886999: <tinfoil> No, but was officially informed the layoffs start today
1288886999: <PipSqueek> 
1288887006: <tinfoil> actually yesterday for a select dew
1288887006: <PipSqueek> 
1288887019: <tinfoil> by the end of the day we'll have ~400 less FTE's
1288887019: <PipSqueek> 
1288887068: <tinfoil> IT is taking the largest hit percentage wise
1288887068: <PipSqueek> 
1288887096: <tinfoil> none of this is "official"
1288887096: <PipSqueek> 
1288887104: <tinfoil> I'm watching google news
1288887104: <PipSqueek> 
1288887120: <tinfoil> Of course, if I get asked to join a random meeting, I'll disconnect
1288887120: <PipSqueek> 
1288887151: <tinfoil> I was hoping that if they were going to let me go, it would have been yesterday :-)
1288887151: <PipSqueek> 
1288887190: <]3d0g> Our stock is up over 6% today. :-P
1288887190: <PipSqueek> 
1288887452: <tinfoil> I heard you guys sign a deal with Clear
1288887452: <PipSqueek> 
1288887460: <tinfoil> to carry 4g service
1288887460: <PipSqueek> 
1288887613: <]3d0g> umm, we're one of the original partners.
1288887613: <PipSqueek> 
1288887633: <]3d0g> I've been carrying a 4G Overdrive for a year now
1288887633: <PipSqueek> 
1288887645: <tinfoil> Oh, I misread an article today
1288887645: <PipSqueek> 
1288887650: <tinfoil> I was skimming :-)
1288887650: <PipSqueek> 
1288887651: <]3d0g> Actually useful now that Denver has 4G.
1288887651: <PipSqueek> 
1288887653: <tinfoil> you're right
1288887653: <PipSqueek> 
1288887658: <tinfoil> Not really
1288887658: <PipSqueek> 
1288887662: <tinfoil> Even employees are capped
1288887662: <PipSqueek> 
1288887682: <tinfoil> It's great for basic connectivity
1288887682: <PipSqueek> 
1288887694: <tinfoil> Watch netflix, you get capped after about 10 minutes
1288887694: <PipSqueek> 
1288887696: <]3d0g> I get 5-6G on mine in downtown Denver. More than adequate.
1288887696: <PipSqueek> 
1288887729: <tinfoil> They don't cap instantly
1288887729: <PipSqueek> 
1288887738: <tinfoil> It's after you reach certain bandwidth usage
1288887738: <PipSqueek> 
1288887744: <]3d0g> As soon as TMO pushes the tether update to my G2 though, I'll return the Overdrive to the pool.
1288887744: <PipSqueek> 
1288887797: <tinfoil> I was complaining about how bad my 4g service became in the last 4 weeks to one of the engineers and he confirmed
1288887797: <PipSqueek> 
1288887821: <tinfoil> they enabled the sandvines in September
1288887821: <PipSqueek> 
1288887844: <]3d0g> HSPA+ keeps getting faster here. I'm regularly seeing 5G+ on speedtests.
1288887844: <PipSqueek> 
1288887858: <tinfoil> Nice
1288887858: <PipSqueek> 
1288887875: <]3d0g> kinda sad my phone now has 4x the internet speed of my house.
1288887875: <PipSqueek> 
1288887899: <tinfoil> hah
1288887899: <PipSqueek> 
1288887915: <tinfoil> I tried to get cable modem installed in my apartment, and comcast said they couldn't do it
1288887915: <PipSqueek> 
1288887935: <tinfoil> my address never had cable, so I'm not in their database and need to call the local office to have them confirm my address exists
1288887935: <PipSqueek> 
1288887988: <tinfoil> Funny because my building was built at the turn of the century
1288887988: <PipSqueek> 
1288888045: <]3d0g> I tried to get Comcast service at our new office in downtown Denver. NFW they said. Had to go with Dish Network.
1288888045: <PipSqueek> 
1288888080: <tinfoil> No shit?
1288888081: <PipSqueek> 
1288888086: <tinfoil> What building you in?
1288888086: <PipSqueek> 
1288888101: <]3d0g> 1430 Wynkoop
1288888101: <PipSqueek> 
1288888105: <tinfoil> I know a some of them are copper bound, no fiber, and no cable
1288888105: <PipSqueek> 
1288888108: <tinfoil> Oh damn, really?
1288888108: <PipSqueek> 
1288888149: <tinfoil> The company that hosts acr0nym's server (forget the name) should be able to offer up to 45Mbps over 2 POTS lines
1288888149: <PipSqueek> 
1288888151: <tinfoil> (2 pair)
1288888151: <PipSqueek> 
1288888162: <tinfoil> You should have that in your building
1288888162: <PipSqueek> 
1288888189: <]3d0g> Qwest had fiber on premises. Got a DS3 turned up in 48 hours.
1288888189: <PipSqueek> 
1288888195: <tinfoil> oh nice!
1288888195: <PipSqueek> 
1288888197: <tinfoil> Okay
1288888197: <PipSqueek> 
1288888209: <tinfoil> Yeah, we'd promote that other service where there wasn't any fiber
1288888209: <PipSqueek> 
1288888332: <tinfoil> tick... tick .... tick...
1288888332: <PipSqueek> 
1288888434: <tinfoil> Heh, doing forensics against 60+ disk images totally about 6.5Tb takes a really, really, really long time
1288888434: <PipSqueek> 
1288888443: <tinfoil> I don't think legal knew what they were in for
1288888443: <PipSqueek> 
1288888453: <tinfoil> thankfully, it will take a lot longer once they drop my ass
1288888453: <PipSqueek> 
1288888825: <tinfoil> Another thing... when each of the 60+ images is unique (ie - no corporate standards, installed by the user), it makes it that much harder
1288888825: <PipSqueek> 
1288888854: <tinfoil> No domain users, no username standards
1288888854: <PipSqueek> 
1288888878: <tinfoil> they had full admin control so I need to look at every detail
1288888878: <PipSqueek> 
1288889077: <dp> ok, seriously; what Unix puts perl/emacs/vim/etc in /usr/local/bin?
1288889077: <PipSqueek> 
1288889098: <hoamchan> ones where you compiled them yourself
1288889098: <PipSqueek> 
1288889117: <hoamchan> sounds like an old version o solaris 
1288889117: <PipSqueek> 
1288889152: <hoamchan> my usr local lib and usr local bin used to be almost as big as usr lib and usr bins
1288889152: <PipSqueek> 
1288889173: <tinfoil> What *chan said
1288889173: <PipSqueek> 
1288889189: <]3d0g> yeah, solaris was really bizarre about /usr/local/bin
1288889189: <PipSqueek> 
1288889213: <hoamchan> well it was more solaris not having all those tools than putting them there intentionally
1288889213: <PipSqueek> 
1288889243: <hoamchan> remember going right to sunsite.unc for all the contrib stuffs
1288889243: <PipSqueek> 
1288889262: <tinfoil> first thing I'd have to download was gcc
1288889262: <PipSqueek> 
1288889297: <hoamchan> yah.  the binary compiler so you could compile your own compiler from source oO
1288889297: <PipSqueek> 
1288889306: <tinfoil> yeah
1288889306: <PipSqueek> 
1288889322: <tinfoil> then download about a dozen gnu packages
1288889322: <PipSqueek> 
1288889340: <hoamchan> leeloo dallas auuuuutooooomaaaaake
1288889340: <PipSqueek> 
1288889345: <tinfoil> screen being the first to get built :-)
1288889345: <PipSqueek> 
1288889360: <hoamchan> and the entire dependency chain for enlightenment 
1288889360: <PipSqueek> 
1288889373: <tinfoil> That was all you, man
1288889373: <PipSqueek> 
1288889379: <tinfoil> I only built E once, and that was with gentoo
1288889379: <PipSqueek> 
1288889384: <tinfoil> I just downloaded the packages
1288889384: <PipSqueek> 
1288889405: <tinfoil> I remember the first time seeing/using E
1288889405: <PipSqueek> 
1288889485: <tinfoil> http://customize.org/efx/skins/681   Remember DR.13 ?
1288889485: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/857a (EFX Skins - Enlightenment DR.13 by Batt98 - Customize.org)
1288889485: <hoamchan> yah
1288889485: <PipSqueek> 
1288889488: <hoamchan> i should see if they ported that to .16
1288889488: <PipSqueek> 
1288889514: <tinfoil> http://vico.kleinplanet.de/screenshots/2001-09-04-012343_1280x1024_scrot.jpg
1288889514: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/857b
1288889542: <hoamchan> wayyy too gratuitous even for me
1288889542: <PipSqueek> 
1288889553: <tinfoil> DR.13 Came with probably the most original desktop theme I've seen to date
1288889553: <PipSqueek> 
1288889562: <hoamchan> lightone has been my theme for over 10 years now
1288889562: <PipSqueek> 
1288889574: <tinfoil> Yeah, I used that one for a few years, thanks to you
1288889574: <PipSqueek> 
1288889628: <tinfoil> Then I converted to DWM
1288889628: <PipSqueek> 
1288889655: <tinfoil> Someone made a variation of DWM that supports multihead, I should check it out
1288889655: <PipSqueek> 
1288889665: <tinfoil> That was the only reason why I ended up dropping it
1288889665: <PipSqueek> 
1288889680: <]3d0g> doubt I'll ever leave xfce
1288889680: <PipSqueek> 
1288889820: <tinfoil> Use the tool that works
1288889820: <PipSqueek> 
1288889826: <tinfoil> Love operating systems that give you that option :-)
1288889826: <PipSqueek> 
1288889833: <]3d0g> indeed
1288889833: <PipSqueek> 
1288890156: <hoamchan> i thought when i was there you were using the standard gnome
1288890156: <PipSqueek> 
1288890198: <tinfoil> hoamchan: I was.
1288890198: <PipSqueek> 
1288890218: <tinfoil> Not so standard
1288890218: <PipSqueek> 
1288890226: <tinfoil> I customized the bits I preferred
1288890226: <PipSqueek> 
1288890238: <tinfoil> such as urxvt
1288890238: <PipSqueek> 
1288890343: <hoamchan> remember how slow the first revisions of gnome were?  and then some default gnome user then saying "enlightenment?  isn't that a pig?"
1288890343: <PipSqueek> 
1288890446: <tinfoil> gnome is still much heavier than E is
1288890446: <PipSqueek> 
1288890530: <-- tinfoil has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
1288890612: <dp> urxvt > *
1288890612: <PipSqueek> 
1288890626: <hoamchan> uh oh
1288890626: <PipSqueek> 
1288890630: <hoamchan> tinfoil drops = paranoia
1288890630: <PipSqueek> 
1288890638: <dp> good point
1288890638: <PipSqueek> 
1288890647: <dp> start texting him
1288890647: <PipSqueek> 
1288890648: <dp> ;)
1288890648: <PipSqueek> 
1288890745: <hoamchan> something sexually explicit?
1288890745: <PipSqueek> 
1288890755: <hoamchan> :::butthead voice::: hey baby.  what are you wearing
1288890755: <PipSqueek> 
1288891053: <]3d0g> too late to change my bet on tinfoil, or are past-post wagers allowed? :-p
1288891053: <PipSqueek> 
1288891131: <dp> lol
1288891131: <PipSqueek> 
1288891298: <acr0nym> hoamchan: How far are you from "Somerset"?
1288891298: <PipSqueek> 
1288891330: <hoamchan> approx 40 mi
1288891330: <PipSqueek> 
1288891337: <hoamchan> you need someone punched in the mouth?
1288891337: <PipSqueek> 
1288891356: <acr0nym> Heh, no, I was looking at this ebay auction, which is local pick-up only:

1288891393: <hoamchan> blueprints?
1288891393: <PipSqueek> 
1288891397: <hoamchan> you have lots o those?
1288891397: <PipSqueek> 
1288891408: <TeleCon> www.msnbc.msn.com site design fucking blows.

1289314154: <PipSqueek> 
1289314163: <fbx> requires one effort every 6 hours
1289314163: <PipSqueek> 
1289314223: <hoamchan> anything facebook related i view as the functional equvalent of not being able to meaningfully describe a single episode or character of friends or seinfeld
1289314223: <PipSqueek> 
1289314238: <hoamchan> not understanding anything facebook related*
1289314238: <PipSqueek> 
1289314257: <hoamchan> more an honor than an omission
1289314257: <PipSqueek> 
1289314295: <fbx> i barely understood that
1289314295: <PipSqueek> 
1289314305: <fbx> it's a tiny time sink, dude
1289314305: <PipSqueek> 
1289314309: <fbx> don't overthink it
1289314309: <PipSqueek> 
1289314543: <hoamchan> i'm sassing you over being there at all
1289314543: <PipSqueek> 
1289314553: <hoamchan> not how much time it eats
1289314553: <PipSqueek> 
1289314622: <hoamchan> just reading about all these grand schemes by businesses to rate and categorize you for things like jobs and loans using everything you volunteer over the net and wondering, what happens when you can't get a job or a credit card because you don't volunteer anything?
1289314622: <PipSqueek> 
1289314635: <fbx> i post the occasional update, political stories, videos to songs stuck in my head for days and play mousehunt and cow click. that's pretty much it, dude.
1289314635: <PipSqueek> 
1289314653: <fbx> oh - and i'm using adblock on every single browser that's on facebook
1289314653: <PipSqueek> 
1289314671: <fbx> so those ads are having trouble reaching me
1289314671: <PipSqueek> 
1289314723: <fbx> i hear you, though
1289314723: <PipSqueek> 
1289314728: <hoamchan> just because you don't see the ads doesn't mean your next prospective employer can't pull your dosier and say "liberal rabblerouser.  won't fit in with our culture"
1289314728: <PipSqueek> 
1289314741: <fbx> probably should have dropped off with the last privacy re-write
1289314741: <PipSqueek> 
1289314793: <fbx> if my next employer is bent on rating me through some poor social network assessment rather than an in-person interview, they can give their job to some other conformist asshole
1289314793: <PipSqueek> 
1289314799: <fbx> they don't rate me
1289314799: <PipSqueek> 
1289314822: <fbx> ...and frankly, i'm not all that spectacular a rate
1289314822: <PipSqueek> 
1289314867: <fbx> but point taken
1289314867: <PipSqueek> 
1289314907: <hoamchan> it's gotten so bad that i contemplate cash based on whether i want a record of the purchase.  i'm not just talking smokes and alcohol, but music as well
1289314907: <PipSqueek> 
1289314943: <hoamchan> it's not that i fear they can read my mind and say "he's a risk" its my fear that they'll even try to begin with
1289314943: <PipSqueek> 
1289314959: <fbx> i don't disagree that such things go on, i just reserve the right to not be pegged all the time
1289314959: <PipSqueek> 
1289315466: <hoamchan> google's a hard one to opt out of but i don't see stories of them leaking data like a sieve 
1289315466: <PipSqueek> 
1289315715: <hoamchan> what really needs to happen is the outing of every purchase profile of every elected official in the house and senate
1289315715: <PipSqueek> 
1289315752: <hoamchan> the only way to get privacy for all is to make sure there is no privacy for the priveleged few
1289315752: <PipSqueek> 
1289315791: <hoamchan> which is why your video rentals are more protected than any other record about you
1289315791: <PipSqueek> 
1289316469: <hoamchan> you following all this crap to fire pilosi ?
1289316469: <PipSqueek>

1289316556: <PipSqueek> 
1289316595: <fbx> she got far more done than a metric fuckton of previous speakers
1289316595: <PipSqueek> 
1289316635: <fbx> too bad the senate couldn't get past the whole "threaten to filibuster everything" problem
1289316635: <PipSqueek> 
1289316657: <fbx> she's not going to be speaker because harry reid can't fucking get legislation passed

1289316760: <PipSqueek>

1289316816: <PipSqueek> 
1289316863: <fbx> are they a spot for net 2.0/ipv6?
1289316863: <PipSqueek> 
1289316877: --> ]3d0g (jkarp@6988929A.F4AE6A51.BF63E968.IP) has joined #lobby

1289316880: <dp> they're govt
1289316880: <PipSqueek>

1289316882: <PipSqueek> 
1289316905: <fbx> oh...gives ipv6 on the link
1289316905: <PipSqueek> 
1289316906: <fbx> sorry
1289316906: <PipSqueek> 
1289316980: <fbx> odd figures, those
1289316980: <PipSqueek> 
1289317003: <fbx> they have to be aggregating a bunch of shit to be true
1289317003: <PipSqueek> 
1289317015: <dp> eh?
1289317015: <PipSqueek> 
1289317106: <fbx> well...maybe not
1289317106: <PipSqueek> 
1289317168: <fbx> they'd need roughly an oc-192 or 10Gb WAN-PHY type connects to have 643Mb = 6% of bandwidth
1289317168: <PipSqueek> 
1289317681: <hoamchan> fire harry.  the only thing the dipshit knows how to do is run his state machine
1289317681: <PipSqueek> 
1289317713: <hoamchan> kudos to being able to unconvincingly beat a mouth breather in a low population election but cmon
1289317713: <PipSqueek> 
1289317715: <fbx> well, he's good at being a minority leader who knows the arcane senate rules, but...besides that...
1289317715: <PipSqueek> 
1289317860: <hoamchan> was a funny read somewhere.  when pubs lose, they doulbe and quadruple down.  when dems lose, they chuck out all the good things they've done that might have angered the pubs
1289317860: <PipSqueek> 
1289318072: <hoamchan> the fact that the talking points say fire pilosi means she now has my support for president
1289318072: <PipSqueek>

1289320850: <PipSqueek> 
1289320882: <hoamchan> the only bright spot for bush is his decision to issue very few pardons
1289320882: <PipSqueek> 
1289320896: <hoamchan> which will be the ultimate black mark on the dems - failure to prosecute
1289320896: <PipSqueek> 
1289320946: <hoamchan> in fact, i'd even consider pardoning bush in return for full testimony against everyone else under him

1289501304: --> tinfoil (d177d406@dp-341749F0.mibbit.com) has joined #lobby
1289501331: <acr0nym> Dude!
1289501331: <PipSqueek> 
1289501333: <acr0nym> Still employed?
1289501333: <PipSqueek> 
1289501337: <tinfoil> At the moment
1289501337: <PipSqueek> 
1289501345: <tinfoil> Who knows for how long
1289501345: <PipSqueek> 
1289501361: <acr0nym> Awesome.  That's the coolest feeling ever.
1289501361: <PipSqueek> 
1289501383: <tinfoil> in a stroke of brilliance, to reduce costs they created a team of people to reduce the number of servers in our datacenter
1289501383: <PipSqueek> 
1289501402: <tinfoil> their methodology?   Find all servers with an average of <15% utilization 
1289501402: <PipSqueek> 
1289501414: <tinfoil> if it's less than 15% it's not utilized
1289501414: <PipSqueek> 
1289501426: <acr0nym> And, it turns out, that if you average 24 hours, they all are?
1289501426: <PipSqueek> 
1289501428: <acr0nym> Heh.
1289501428: <PipSqueek> 
1289501431: <tinfoil> therefore the owner needs to justify it's existance
1289501431: <PipSqueek> 
1289501447: <tinfoil> Not all
1289501447: <PipSqueek> 
1289501451: <tinfoil> But here's the deal
1289501451: <PipSqueek> 
1289501464: <tinfoil> most of the servers they are going after are VIRTUAL
1289501464: <PipSqueek> 
1289501469: <acr0nym> Hah!
1289501469: <PipSqueek> 
1289501477: <tinfoil> Which is the point of making them virtual in the first place
1289501477: <PipSqueek> 
1289501481: <acr0nym> Which means, someone already figgered out they were low utilization....  ;)
1289501481: <PipSqueek> 
1289501495: <TeleCon> lol
1289501495: <PipSqueek> 
1289501525: <tinfoil> It's in our new datacenter
1289501525: <PipSqueek> 
1289501543: <tinfoil> I'm tempted to publicaly question this
1289501543: <PipSqueek> 
1289501554: <acr0nym> Yeah, what can they do, fire you?  Heh.
1289501554: <PipSqueek> 
1289501576: <tinfoil> Well, there isn't a history of paperwork showing my poor performance
1289501576: <PipSqueek> 
1289501581: <tinfoil> so I'll get unemployment
1289501581: <PipSqueek> 
1289501594: <tinfoil> Here's the deal though
1289501594: <PipSqueek> 
1289501621: <tinfoil> the contract they signed with the service company is on a per-server basis, with no consession for virtual servers
1289501621: <PipSqueek> 
1289501635: <tinfoil> so the more servers we have, virtual or otherwise, the more we get raped
1289501635: <PipSqueek> 
1289501657: <tinfoil> And they manage the vmware clusters and create the inventory
1289501657: <PipSqueek> 
1289501708: <acr0nym> I believe I'm gonna have to give these a try.
1289501708: <PipSqueek> 
1289501720: <acr0nym> http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/claire-robinson/earl-grey-shortbread-cookies-recipe/index.html
1289501720: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/87zN (Earl Grey Shortbread Cookies Recipe : Claire Robinson : Food Network)
1289501779: <tinfoil> Oh yes, a bakery by me makes something similar
1289501779: <PipSqueek> 
1289501790: <tinfoil> randomly, their shortbreat cookies are on random rotation
1289501790: <PipSqueek> 
1289501798: <acr0nym> I suspect greatness for my nomming.
1289501798: <PipSqueek> 
1289501800: <tinfoil> AWESOME
1289501800: <PipSqueek> 
1289501817: <tinfoil> If they are done right, they are buttery and mildly salty
1289501817: <PipSqueek> 
1289501846: <acr0nym> Yeah, that recipe looks promising for it.
1289501846: <PipSqueek> 
1289501887: <acr0nym> Also, I will probably push it to a whole teaspoon of kosher salt, since I suspect that recipe assumes table salt.
1289501887: <PipSqueek> 
1289501954: <tinfoil> Might be good to reduce it a little, then add a little on the outside... at least as an experiment
1289501954: <PipSqueek> 
1289501972: <tinfoil> Some cookies do well with a little salt externally
1289501972: <PipSqueek> 
1289502042: <acr0nym> Jah.  We'll see.
1289502042: <PipSqueek> 
1289503476: <acr0nym> Okay, who, besides me, would consider this to be a perfectly good connection to a vendor off-campus?
1289503476: <PipSqueek> 
1289503478: <acr0nym> Success rate is 95 percent (952/1000), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/5/204 ms uofcoloradovp001#
1289503478: <PipSqueek> 
1289503500: <dp> not perfectly good, but damned close
1289503500: <PipSqueek> 
1289503509: <tinfoil> that's not bad...
1289503509: <PipSqueek> 
1289503519: <tinfoil> The loss makes me wonder...
1289503519: <PipSqueek> 
1289503524: <acr0nym> Seriously, 5ms average?
1289503524: <PipSqueek> 
1289503551: <dp> over how long?
1289503551: <PipSqueek> 
1289503559: <dp> 24 hours? :)
1289503559: <PipSqueek> 
1289503567: <acr0nym> By the way, retards, WE DON'T CONTROL THE WHOLE FUCKING INTERNET!
1289503567: <PipSqueek> 
1289503572: <acr0nym> I hate these.
1289503572: <PipSqueek> 
1289503624: <acr0nym> "If you want a reliable connection with your vendor, here's Qwest's number, I suggest you pay them directly for 2 OC-3's, point-to-point."
1289503624: <PipSqueek> 
1289503646: <dp> I'll take one of those for our office please
1289503646: <PipSqueek> 
1289503752: <acr0nym> Here's the ping command they used: "ping 209.245.23.201 repeat 1000"
1289503752: <PipSqueek> 
1289503761: <acr0nym> I'm not sure WHAT device has ping implemented that way....
1289503761: <PipSqueek> 
1289503763: <dp> I've never seen that before
1289503763: <PipSqueek> 
1289503765: <acr0nym> I've never seen it before.
1289503765: <PipSqueek> 
1289503782: <dp> windows?
1289503782: <PipSqueek> 
1289503798: <acr0nym> Nope.
1289503798: <PipSqueek> 
1289503817: <dp> hrm; bsd?
1289503817: <PipSqueek> 
1289503828: <dp> I'm throwing darts now
1289503828: <PipSqueek> 
1289503829: <acr0nym> BTW, though, I just pinged from an Ubuntu machine, to deepthought, and got 89 packets/84 recieved, 5% packet loss.
1289503829: <PipSqueek> 
1289503859: <acr0nym> min/avg/max was 3.265/7.533/232.478
1289503859: <PipSqueek> 
1289503868: <acr0nym> YOU FUCKERS HAVE A RELIABLE CONNECTION.
1289503868: <PipSqueek> 
1289503879: <acr0nym> your vendor sells shit, and is trying to blame your network!
1289503879: <PipSqueek> 
1289503881: <acr0nym> Sheesh.
1289503881: <PipSqueek> 
1289503906: <dp> lol. greetz for tinfoil
1289503906: <PipSqueek> 
1289503908: <acr0nym> Oh, I better be careful, that address is on TeleCon's network...  ;)
1289503908: <PipSqueek> 
1289503928: <dp> I wonder if mibbit auto-rejoins on kick
1289503928: <PipSqueek> 
1289503948: <dp> nope, it doesn't
1289503948: <PipSqueek> 
1289503955: <tinfoil> I'd be more impressed if they ran "mtr --report --count 1000 --interval 1"
1289503955: <PipSqueek> 
1289503967: <tinfoil> (I expended for readability)
1289503967: <PipSqueek> 
1289503973: <tinfoil> expAnded
1289503973: <PipSqueek> 
1289504009: <acr0nym> Hrm.  My mtr doesn't recognize --count
1289504009: <PipSqueek> 
1289504075: <tinfoil> I might have chose the wrong option
1289504075: <PipSqueek> 
1289504076: <tinfoil> whoops
1289504076: <PipSqueek> 
1289504080: * tinfoil has bad memory
1289504092: <dp> ditt
1289504092: <PipSqueek> 
1289504093: <dp> ditto
1289504093: <PipSqueek> 
1289504095: <tinfoil> If you do it for 1000, the report will take forever :-)
1289504095: <PipSqueek> 
1289504106: <dp> I think you want --report-cycles
1289504106: <PipSqueek> 
1289504110: <tinfoil> but it will be very detailed and accurate
1289504110: <PipSqueek> 
1289504264: <dp> wow. I have almost 50% packet loss to my server
1289504264: <PipSqueek> 
1289504294: <dp> make that 70
1289504294: <PipSqueek> 
1289504379: <acr0nym> Yeah, their connection to that IP address is slightly better than mine to deepthought.
1289504379: <PipSqueek> 
1289504394: <dp> how do you even read the output of mtr?
1289504394: <acr0nym> I wonder what they're imagining can be done.
1289504394: <PipSqueek> 
1289504394: <PipSqueek> 
1289504410: <acr0nym> Also, I'll point out, I can sustain about 12MB/s between my desktop and deepthought.
1289504410: <PipSqueek> 
1289504478: <dp> I'm getting timeouts all over the place
1289504478: <PipSqueek> 
1289504591: <tinfoil> Don't you love MTR?  Now where a majority of the loss taking place?
1289504591: <PipSqueek> 
1289504592: <dp> I have packets coming from Louisville (final destination in Tampa), going to ATL -> NYC -> MIA -> TPA
1289504592: <PipSqueek> 
1289504610: <tinfoil> I do love how MTR does account for multiple paths
1289504610: <PipSqueek> 
1289504618: <dp> tinfoil: that depends on how I'm supposed to read it; what does the loss column imply, loss directly to that switch?
1289504618: <PipSqueek> 
1289504698: <tinfoil> It's loss at that stop in the journey.  It works like traceroute, but using ICMP-EchoRequest.  ie - it pings with a IP TTL of 1,2,3,4,5...MAX
1289504698: <PipSqueek> 
1289504734: <tinfoil> then it bases the results on the ICMP-DestUnReach or ICMP-EchoReplyreplies
1289504734: <PipSqueek> 
1289504754: <dp> I'm getting 20% loss to 3 different sprint switches
1289504754: <PipSqueek> 
1289504758: <dp> and 1 tinet switch
1289504758: <PipSqueek> 
1289504762: <tinfoil> Of course if the loss occurs before that stop, it still looses the packet
1289504762: <PipSqueek> 
1289504775: <tinfoil> I usually start troubleshooting at the first point of repeat loss

1289513487: <tinfoil> Blahaha, a guy in my office with a nerf gun is complaining that he shot at someone 11 times and missed him every time.  My boss goes "You must be a bad guy."   "What?"  "Bad guys are ALWAYS bad shots."  Then proceeds to take the gun from him, walk back and shot him in the chest from about 20 ft.  "See, I'm a good guy"
1289513487: <PipSqueek>

1289845371: <PipSqueek> 
1289845385: <tinfoil> scp - bytes and lperf is bits, IIRC... but that doesn't account for all of it

1289846254: <dp> interesting
1289846254: <PipSqueek> 
1289846265: <dp> facebook has switched away from cassandra to hBase
1289846265: <PipSqueek> 
1289846301: <tinfoil> Did they say why?
1289846301: <PipSqueek> 
1289846332: <dp> because of this "mail" thing they're trying to do
1289846332: <PipSqueek> 
1289846354: <tinfoil> Ohhh... hbase is something I've never looked at
1289846354: <PipSqueek> 
1289846356: <tinfoil> interesting
1289846356: <PipSqueek> 
1289846549: <tinfoil> "There is no mature distributed database option. HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra, CouchDB, MongoDB, Voldemort‚Ä¶ They all have sharp edges. You are going to get cut and you are going to bleed."

1289846811: <PipSqueek>

1289846849: <PipSqueek> 
1289846888: <tinfoil> Years afo I'd say buffers
1289846888: <PipSqueek> 
1289846898: <tinfoil> but I thought all ssh was patched for that
1289846898: <PipSqueek> 
1289846921: <tinfoil> SSH had issues with data throughput, but it was originally thought to be encryption/compression slowdown
1289846921: <PipSqueek> 
1289846941: <tinfoil> ends up it was that it wasn't designed for file transfers and it's buffers were meant for more console use
1289846941: <PipSqueek> 
1289846956: <tinfoil> so someone write a patch for openssh to have larger send buffers
1289846956: <PipSqueek> 
1289846964: <acr0nym> Nothing should have changed on the linux side.  I typically get 12 MB/s.

1289846966: <PipSqueek>

1289846987: <PipSqueek>

1289847842: <PipSqueek> 
1289847901: <tinfoil> If I were an ISP with customers, I'l probably have something like that in place
1289847901: <PipSqueek> 
1289847939: <acr0nym> Except that a good friend of mine is the VP for Forethought, and actually pretty much runs the company, and has made it very clear to his employees that he'll be very mad if I get screwed with.
1289847939: <PipSqueek> 
1289847959: <acr0nym> Also, wouldn't they mess with Bittorrent first?
1289847959: <PipSqueek> 
1289847967: <acr0nym> I'm averaging around 1.2mb/s with BT.

1289848660: <PipSqueek> 
1289848732: <kbwichan> that's a typical move by them - fund a 3rd party to dip the toe in the water.  if they like the response and the prospects, drive that 3rd party out of business by defunding and demanding a higher cost per sub at every contract negotiation.  see @home

1289852765: <tinfoil> Ok, as long as it's not putty (totally unoptimized)
1289852765: <PipSqueek> 
1289852774: <tinfoil> that is during a transfer?
1289852774: <PipSqueek> 
1289852775: <tinfoil> Hrm
1289852775: <PipSqueek> 
1289852776: <tinfoil> Ok
1289852776: <PipSqueek> 
1289852780: <tinfoil> I figured it was worth looking at
1289852780: <PipSqueek> 
1289852834: <tinfoil> I'd look at a TCP dump to see if you are getting any source quenches from the destination side or middle routers
1289852834: <PipSqueek> 
1289852906: <tinfoil> wireshark will work
1289852906: <PipSqueek> 
1289852946: <tinfoil> It might give you an indication if any hops along the way are telling you to slow down
1289852946: <PipSqueek> 
1289852996: <acr0nym> Interestin.  I am seeing a lot of "Bad checksum" packets....
1289852996: <PipSqueek> 
1289853037: <tinfoil> Now that is interesting
1289853037: <PipSqueek> 
1289853054: <tinfoil> Can you tell who is saying you have bad checksum?
1289853054: <PipSqueek> 
1289853162: <acr0nym> Uh, no.  I don't use Wireshark enough.
1289853162: <PipSqueek> 
1289853174: <tinfoil> Me neither... 
1289853174: <PipSqueek> 
1289853376: <tinfoil> Wow, I just did my first job search
1289853376: <PipSqueek> 
1289853450: <tinfoil> By the way, I'm starting to enjoy playing with Zenoss 3
1289853450: <PipSqueek> 
1289853457: <tinfoil> It's not bad
1289853457: <PipSqueek> 
1289853460: <dp> eh?
1289853460: <PipSqueek> 
1289853487: <tinfoil> I was told to build a Zenoss instance here
1289853487: <PipSqueek> 
1289853489: <tinfoil> and I'm enjoying it
1289853489: <PipSqueek> 
1289853878: <acr0nym> Okaaaay.  Completely bizarre.
1289853878: <PipSqueek> 
1289853896: <acr0nym> I'm getting better throughput from the wireless network her than I am the wired network.
1289853896: <PipSqueek> 
1289853910: <acr0nym> here, even.
1289853910: <PipSqueek> 
1289853915: <tinfoil> I've been observing a mildly annoying trend on twitter... URL shorteners that embed the destination in a (i)frame and include their own navigation/advertising on display
1289853915: <PipSqueek> 
1289854148: <tinfoil> Also, have you noticed the annoying advertising that comes with google web cache?
1289854148: <PipSqueek> 
1289854269: <tinfoil>   I'm just annoyed that advertising is becoming more obtrusive
1289854269: <PipSqueek> 
1289854293: <]3d0g> the whole goddamned internet's annoying IMO
1289854293: <PipSqueek> 
1289854402: <tinfoil> Oh, I see... incognitio mode disabled my adblock
1289854402: <PipSqueek> 
1289854404: <tinfoil> better
1289854404: <PipSqueek> 
1289855275: <TeleCon> Bad wired router?
1289855275: <PipSqueek> 
1289855285: <TeleCon> What does mtr show?
1289855285: <PipSqueek> 
1289855316: <acr0nym> Heh, it's showing some strange stuff, but, it was last week, too, when traffic was going fine.
1289855316: <PipSqueek> 
1289855334: <tinfoil> So, what changed with networking between now and then?
1289855334: <PipSqueek> 
1289855361: <]3d0g> Is the ring loose somewhere and tokens are leaking?
1289855361: <PipSqueek> 
1289855406: <tinfoil> Heheh
1289855406: <PipSqueek> 
1289855491: <TeleCon> Are you misrouted over a barbwire arcnet someplace?
1289855491: <PipSqueek> 
1289855524: <acr0nym> Heh, strangely enough, it's level3 that always seems to drop the most packets.

1289855604: <acr0nym> Heh.
1289855604: <PipSqueek> 
1289855607: <dp> alright linux admins; how does one create a static route?
1289855607: <PipSqueek> 
1289855608: <fbx> sorry
1289855608: <PipSqueek> 
1289855633: <acr0nym> dp: "man route"
1289855633: <PipSqueek> 
1289855634: <acr0nym> Heh.
1289855634: <PipSqueek> 
1289855650: <tinfoil> route add 0.0.0.0/32 gw 123.45.67.89 
1289855650: <PipSqueek> 
1289855670: <tinfoil> make sure gw is a host that is in a local subnet
1289855670: <PipSqueek> 
1289855674: <dp> tinfoil: will that force packets to go out the gateway, no matter what?
1289855674: <PipSqueek> 
1289855692: <fbx> for that address it should
1289855692: <PipSqueek> 
1289855694: <tinfoil> for the specific route you add, yes
1289855694: <PipSqueek> 
1289855701: <dp> ok
1289855701: <PipSqueek> 
1289855702: <acr0nym> Heh, what's "0.0.0.0/32"?
1289855702: <PipSqueek> 
1289855704: <dp> lets see here
1289855704: <PipSqueek> 
1289855713: <fbx> acr0nym: unroutable?
1289855713: <PipSqueek> 
1289855716: <fbx> ;)
1289855716: <PipSqueek> 
1289855718: <tinfoil> Remember, routes are in priority of the most specific route
1289855718: <PipSqueek> 
1289855727: <TeleCon> acr0nym: Is the juniper thingy up to date on firmware?
1289855727: <PipSqueek> 
1289855727: <fbx> 123.45.67.89/32
1289855728: <PipSqueek> 
1289855736: <tinfoil> so 0.0.0.0/32 will always trump 0.0.0.0/30
1289855736: <PipSqueek> 
1289855739: <tinfoil> etc
1289855739: <PipSqueek> 
1289855761: <tinfoil> My syntax might be a little off
1289855761: <PipSqueek> 
1289855767: <tinfoil> but "man route" will correct
1289855767: <PipSqueek> 
1289855773: <tinfoil> it's been a while
1289855773: <PipSqueek> 
1289855774: <acr0nym> TeleCon: Beats me.
1289855774: <PipSqueek> 
1289855792: <acr0nym> But, how is that you're concern, when ALL the level3 hops are dropping?
1289855792: <acr0nym> Heh.
1289855792: <PipSqueek> 
1289855792: <PipSqueek> 
1289855812: <acr0nym> Uh, how is that the main concern, I mean.
1289855812: <PipSqueek> 
1289855820: <fbx> don't you have to put a dev name at the end, tinfoil ?
1289855820: <PipSqueek> 
1289855828: <tinfoil> Sounds like a normal level 3 routing
1289855828: <PipSqueek> 
1289855844: <tinfoil> fbx: Not usually
1289855844: <PipSqueek> 
1289855865: <tinfoil> fbx: remember the gateway address *MUST* be locally routable
1289855865: <PipSqueek> 
1289855879: <tinfoil> so your machine will figure out what interface it is, or tell you it can't route to that address
1289855879: <PipSqueek> 
1289855899: <fbx> right
1289855899: <PipSqueek> 
1289855922: <dp> if I add a bad route, what will happen to outbound traffic (HTTP responses, ssh packets, etc) ?
1289855922: <PipSqueek> 
1289856012: <TeleCon> I bet internal tools don't show any packet loss.
1289856012: <PipSqueek> 
1289856029: <tinfoil> It depends on the route you add... if you override a network you're on and it's bad, your connection will drop
1289856029: <PipSqueek> 
1289856038: <dp> tinfoil: that's what I though
1289856038: <PipSqueek> 
1289856041: <dp> thought
1289856041: <PipSqueek> 
1289856042: <dp> fail
1289856042: <PipSqueek> 
1289856053: <fbx> tinfoil: you mean your connection will dr-
1289856053: <PipSqueek> 
1289856057: <dp> lol
1289856057: <PipSqueek> 
1289856062: <tinfoil> dp:  Yeah, never do a route change involving your address unless you have a backup plan
1289856062: <PipSqueek> 
1289856201: <]3d0g> We had an unscheduled L3 outage from 2:50 to 3:10AM this morning.
1289856201: <PipSqueek> 
1289856248: <dp> hrm. thoughts on using a private IP space with a public spaced gateway?
1289856248: <PipSqueek> 
1289856271: <tinfoil> Need diagram to answer
1289856271: <PipSqueek> 
1289856272: <]3d0g> "public spaced"?
1289856272: <PipSqueek> 
1289856276: <fbx> see my line above?
1289856276: <PipSqueek> 
1289856303: <dp> ]3d0g: box A has IP 10.0.0.21; it's connected to a switch (which will be the gateway) that has public IP 216.26.139.75
1289856303: <PipSqueek> 
1289856326: <tinfoil> a switch, or router/firewall?
1289856326: <PipSqueek> 
1289856338: <dp> actually, a load-balancer with a switch built in
1289856338: <PipSqueek> 
1289856359: <]3d0g> and you're expecting 10.0.0.21 to be able to reach beyond 216.26.139.75?
1289856359: <PipSqueek> 
1289856363: <tinfoil> Foundry? (curious)
1289856363: <PipSqueek> 
1289856377: <dp> tinfoil: coyote
1289856377: <PipSqueek> 
1289856379: <dp> ]3d0g: yes
1289856379: <PipSqueek> 
1289856404: <dp> actually, wait
1289856404: <PipSqueek> 
1289856408: <dp> it has an internal IP as well
1289856408: <PipSqueek> 
1289856429: <dp> and even though it's the default gw, in theory, I should be able to static route through that private IP, right?
1289856429: <PipSqueek> 
1289856596: <tinfoil> Assuming that devices past that gateway know how to get back to you
1289856596: <PipSqueek> 
1289856618: <tinfoil> Lets say you have 3 devices   A - B - C  ...
1289856618: <PipSqueek> 
1289856629: <tinfoil> C and A need to route through B to see each other
1289856629: <PipSqueek> 
1289856648: <tinfoil> you tell C that in order to talk to A, it needs to route through B
1289856648: <PipSqueek> 
1289856653: <tinfoil> But unless you tell A the same thing, it won't work
1289856653: <PipSqueek> 
1289856677: <tinfoil> "I hear you knocking, but you can't come in...."
1289856677: <PipSqueek> 
1289857005: <dp> which is fine
1289857005: <PipSqueek> 
1289857019: <dp> all of these boxes will be going throught the LB
1289857019: <PipSqueek> 
1289857473: <dp> hrm
1289857473: <PipSqueek> 
1289857626: <dp> ok
1289857626: <PipSqueek> 
1289857642: <dp> box A, which has IP 10.0.0.21, I've done route add 10.0.0.21 gw 10.0.0.1 dev eth1
1289857642: <PipSqueek> 
1289857647: <dp> 10.0.0.1 is the LB
1289857647: <PipSqueek> 
1289857686: <tinfoil> what is box c?
1289857686: <PipSqueek> 
1289857703: <dp> box C, which has IP 10.0.0.31, I've done route add 10.0.0.31 gw 10.0.0.1 dev eth1
1289857703: <PipSqueek> 
1289857715: <tinfoil> netmask?
1289857715: <PipSqueek> 
1289857736: <dp> 255.255.255.255; though the default gw netmask is 255.255.255.0
1289857736: <PipSqueek> 
1289857762: <dp> is that incorrect?
1289857762: <PipSqueek> 
1289857763: <tinfoil> so all three devices are 10.0.0.0/24 ?
1289857763: <PipSqueek> 
1289857770: <dp> yes
1289857770: <PipSqueek> 
1289857788: <tinfoil> And they are all plugged into the same switch?
1289857788: <PipSqueek> 
1289857791: <dp> yes
1289857791: <PipSqueek> 
1289857806: <tinfoil> Uh, they _should_ see each other without a route
1289857806: <PipSqueek> 
1289857809: <dp> box B (the load balancer) *is* the switch
1289857809: <PipSqueek> 
1289857824: <dp> tinfoil: they do
1289857824: <PipSqueek>

1289859727: <PipSqueek>

1289859732: <PipSqueek> 
1289859742: <dp> I was told by Coyote support that I needed a static route to make it work
1289859742: <PipSqueek> 
1289859746: <tinfoil> but since I don't know anything about the device or it's configuration, I don't know if I can help further
1289859746: <PipSqueek> 
1289859766: <tinfoil> Does the Coyote know it's suposed to route those?
1289859766: <PipSqueek> 
1289859774: <tinfoil> if not, it'll just ignore it
1289859774: <PipSqueek> 
1289859780: <dp> which, the private, or the public?
1289859780: <PipSqueek> 
1289859782: <tinfoil> but routing two devices with the same netmask gets confusing
1289859782: <PipSqueek> 
1289860148: <tinfoil> dp:  Honestly I'd consider plugging in those devices to a second switch
1289860148: <PipSqueek> 
1289860163: <tinfoil> Static routing is like duct tape
1289860163: <PipSqueek> 
1289860176: <tinfoil> it works, but it really should be avoided when fixing stuff

1289914448: <dp> kbwichan: you ever have trouble with xscreensaver not wanting to start?
1289914448: <PipSqueek> 
1289919169: <kbwichan> not wanting to start on session start?  or not wanting to start on ctrl alt L or whatever your hotkey is?  or not wanting to start after the proper idle timeout?
1289919169: <PipSqueek> 
1289919212: <kbwichan> look at my sessionstart script in .e16
1289919212: <PipSqueek> 
1289919220: <kbwichan> i actually call gnome-screensaver
1289919220: <PipSqueek> 
1289919233: <kbwichan> if you're running xscreen instead of gnomescreen you may need to alter that

1289919276: <dp> and xscreensaver is started
1289919276: <PipSqueek> 
1289919301: <kbwichan> is there an xscreensaver-preferences gui?
1289919301: <PipSqueek> 
1289919315: <kbwichan> usually if you try to launch that it will tell you if it can connect to the screensaver daemon
1289919315: <PipSqueek> 
1289919323: <kbwichan> if it can't that's a smoking gun right there
1289919323: <PipSqueek>

1289934451: <PipSqueek> 
1289934452: <]3d0g> I've (obviously) got a G2 and also a Sprint Overdrive. While not exactly the same thing, I have noticed TMO keeps getting faster and Sprint's 4G keeps getting slower.

1289934526: <PipSqueek> 
1289934539: <tinfoil> It's a night and day difference from 2 months ago
1289934539: <PipSqueek> 
1289934559: <]3d0g> that's consistent with what I saw here in Denver.
1289934559: <PipSqueek> 
1289934579: <tinfoil> I can't work for a company that I've lost faith in
1289934579: <PipSqueek>

1289934606: <PipSqueek> 
1289934613: <]3d0g> I don't believe Sprint's even formally announced 4G here yet. I just know when I started building out the Denver office, one day the Overdrive came up 4G instead of 3G. Life was good. It screamed. 
1289934613: <PipSqueek> 
1289934627: <]3d0g> Now it's lucky to get 3Mbs.
1289934627: <PipSqueek>

1289934638: <PipSqueek>

1289934662: <PipSqueek>

1289934686: <PipSqueek> 
1289934709: <tinfoil> I'm far from disappointed, I'm pissed
1289934709: <PipSqueek> 
1289934728: <tinfoil> Especially when our CEO was saying 6 months ago that we would not cap
1289934728: <PipSqueek> 
1289934745: <tinfoil> And reasonably we should, but only for upstream since WiMax is 1/2 duplex
1289934745: <PipSqueek> 
1289934757: <TeleCon> Well, you aren't really capped, just degraded.
1289934757: <PipSqueek> 
1289934773: <tinfoil> true
1289934773: <PipSqueek> 
1289934795: <tinfoil> but it's to the point that if I VPN in that SSH is barely usable
1289934795: <PipSqueek> 
1289934812: <tinfoil> the latency is horrid
1289934812: <PipSqueek>

1289934826: <PipSqueek> 
1289934844: <]3d0g> I can run a VNC session over TMO just fine. Sprint blows.
1289934844: <PipSqueek> 
1289934855: <tinfoil> Seriously, when I first got it, the throughput was better than my DSL, and the latency was reasonable for wireless
1289934855: <PipSqueek> 
1289934927: <tinfoil> I don't use P2P, I don't do massive uploads, I watch netflix, browse the web, and VPN to work.  Hell, I don't even do porn any more
1289934927: <PipSqueek> 
1289934932: <tinfoil> This is not unreasonable usage
1289934932: <PipSqueek>

1289940293: <PipSqueek> 
1289940295: <dp> but
1289940295: <PipSqueek> 
1289940310: <dp> Can Wayland be used with the closed source proprietary graphics drivers?
1289940310: <PipSqueek> 
1289940310: <dp> No
1289940310: <PipSqueek> 
1289940315: <dp> Will toolkits (Qt, GTK+, etc.) need to be ported to work on Wayland?
1289940315: <PipSqueek> 
1289940316: <dp> Yes.
1289940316: <PipSqueek> 
1289940319: <dp> Will window managers need to be rewritten for Wayland?
1289940319: <PipSqueek> 
1289940320: <dp> Yes.
1289940320: <PipSqueek> 
1289940323: <dp> Will applications need to be rewritten or modified to work on Wayland?

1289940323: <dp> Yes, 
1289940323: <PipSqueek>

1289940691: <tinfoil> So... uh, it only works with open source video drivers too

1289941000: <tinfoil> Essencially they are going to start supporting it but not aiming to make it the default in the near term, but once it is they will still run X within a support layer

1289941462: <tinfoil> While supporting Xorg is good, it's ultimately limited by X's architecture.  It's like performance tuning a diesel truck for road racing, when you can start with chassis more designed for the task.
1289941462: <PipSqueek> 
1289941495: <tinfoil> Of course, I'm not stating I support the decision overall, but the display engine on linux is a major holdup and has been for years
1289941495: <PipSqueek> 
1289941537: <tinfoil> Of course, make a more light weight and faster display engine, and Gnome/KDE had more excuse not to optimize :-p
1289941537: <PipSqueek> 
1289942198: <]3d0g> yes, because adding yet ANOTHER layer of abstraction under X is a stellar idea. I suggest ubuntu wedge in virtualbox in there somewhere too.

1289942410: <dp> ]3d0g: most of the problem is the forwarding over X capability
1289942410: <PipSqueek> 
1289942424: <dp> apparently, that's *extremely* difficult, and buggy
1289942424: <PipSqueek> 
1289942437: <tinfoil> http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2010-November/145273.html 
1289942437: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/8$0G (Ubuntu moving towards Wayland)
1289942440: <]3d0g> forwarding as in remote viewing? 
1289942440: <PipSqueek> 
1289942461: <dp> I believe so
1289942461: <PipSqueek> 
1289942482: <tinfoil> The issue is that X can't be retrofited to do what OSX and now Windows are moving towards, it would have to be re-written
1289942482: <PipSqueek> 
1289942485: <acr0nym> Remote viewing?  I totally gotta watch "Men Who Stare at Goats" again....
1289942485: <PipSqueek> 
1289942490: <]3d0g> pfft. I, as most linux users, use it daily. 
1289942490: <PipSqueek> 
1289942500: <dp> "most"?
1289942500: <PipSqueek> 
1289942506: <]3d0g> it's the #1 gripe against Wayland. 
1289942506: <PipSqueek> 
1289942508: <dp> I've never used it
1289942508: <PipSqueek> 
1289942511: <dp> not once
1289942511: <PipSqueek> 
1289942518: <]3d0g> You've never installed Oracle?
1289942518: <PipSqueek> 
1289942520: <dp> I don't even know how it would be useful
1289942520: <PipSqueek> 
1289942522: <dp> nope
1289942522: <PipSqueek> 
1289942523: <acr0nym> You really are the unusual one...
1289942523: <PipSqueek> 
1289942528: <]3d0g> Never ran netbackup?
1289942528: <PipSqueek> 
1289942533: <dp> netbackup?
1289942533: <PipSqueek> 
1289942534: <acr0nym> I even use it frequently.
1289942534: <PipSqueek> 
1289942538: <tinfoil> ]3d0g: I would have to say that RDP is far more efficient and effective than remote X.
1289942538: <PipSqueek> 
1289942549: <tinfoil> but yes, I use remote X too
1289942549: <PipSqueek> 
1289942561: <dp> my servers are all headless
1289942561: <PipSqueek> 
1289942568: <dp> if I can't do it with ssh, it doesn't need to be done
1289942568: <PipSqueek> 
1289942574: <TeleCon> Men who Stare at Goats is a great movie.
1289942574: <PipSqueek> 
1289942578: <]3d0g> Not when you just want an app and not the entire desktop. RDP is weaksauce.
1289942578: <PipSqueek> 
1289942580: <tinfoil> TeleCon: Agreed
1289942580: <PipSqueek> 
1289942604: <]3d0g> I thought it was stupid until I found out later it was mostly a true story.
1289942604: <PipSqueek> 
1289942616: <acr0nym> Oh, see, I had known that....
1289942616: <PipSqueek> 
1289942623: <acr0nym> that's WHY I dug it.
1289942623: <PipSqueek> 
1289942637: <tinfoil> ]3d0g: Here's the neat thing,  RDP *CAN* do a single app - I've done it.  The catch is, that it's not easy enough for most windows users to figure out
1289942637: <PipSqueek> 
1289942638: <]3d0g> Can totally see that now.
1289942638: <PipSqueek> 
1289942638: <acr0nym> I have the original documentary, if you wanna copy.  Heh.
1289942638: <PipSqueek> 
1289942675: <]3d0g> exactly tinfoil. As long as I've logged in ssh -X, I just run my commands. no setup, no thinking about it.
1289942675: <PipSqueek> 
1289942681: <tinfoil> ]3d0g: Don't forget, most windows users don't think like linux users... period.  RDP is a great tech that windows does do better than linux.
1289942681: <PipSqueek> 
1289942706: <]3d0g> they still think digital wristwatches are a pretty cool idea too.
1289942706: <PipSqueek> 
1289942711: <tinfoil> My point is, don't talk shit about tech when the tech is solid, just not implemented the way you like
1289942711: <PipSqueek> 
1289942717: <acr0nym> Dude, you and I have the SAME WATCH.
1289942717: <PipSqueek> 
1289942726: <]3d0g> and it's ANALOG!
1289942726: <PipSqueek> 
1289942734: <acr0nym> Except for the digital part....
1289942734: <PipSqueek> 
1289942738: <]3d0g> hehe
1289942738: <PipSqueek> 
1289942744: <acr0nym> Punk ass.
1289942744: <PipSqueek> 
1289942747: <]3d0g> pretty cool too :)
1289942747: <PipSqueek> 
1289942750: <acr0nym> Heh, indeed.
1289942750: <PipSqueek> 
1289942764: <acr0nym> Also, I'm not sure I'm a typical windows, linux, or osx user.
1289942764: <PipSqueek> 
1289942765: <]3d0g> Not dissing the tech at ALL tinfoil. I use RDP loads. 
1289942765: <PipSqueek> 
1289942777: <]3d0g> Different animal than X forwarding IMO.
1289942777: <PipSqueek> 
1289942785: <acr0nym> VNC for EVERYTHING.
1289942785: <PipSqueek> 
1289942785: <acr0nym> Heh.
1289942785: <PipSqueek> 
1289942792: <tinfoil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoPiJOubR-4 - ]3d0g is on the right.  :-)

1289942845: <dp> yay pithos!

1289942848: <PipSqueek> 
1289942869: <tinfoil> Either way, I feel weyland isn
1289942869: <PipSqueek> 
1289942872: <tinfoil> 't a bad diea
1289942872: <PipSqueek> 
1289942873: <tinfoil> idea
1289942873: <PipSqueek> 
1289942881: <tinfoil> but it's going to be a painful transition
1289942881: <PipSqueek> 
1289942895: <]3d0g> OR, fix X. Not so painful transition. 
1289942895: <PipSqueek> 
1289942981: <tinfoil> Like window managers, I won't argue if there is an option
1289942981: <PipSqueek> 
1289942995: <tinfoil> And like Ubuntu said, X will be around for a long time
1289942995: <PipSqueek> 
1289943046: <tinfoil> My more immediate concern is when the hell gimp will get off it's lazy ass and support more then 8-bits per color channel
1289943046: <PipSqueek> 
1289943165: <dp> ;)
1289943165: <PipSqueek> 
1289943810: <acr0nym> NEVER.
1289943810: <PipSqueek> 
1289943849: <acr0nym> Pony up and pay for real tools, OSS slacker boy.
1289943849: <PipSqueek> 
1289943877: <acr0nym> Using Open Source is like stealing food straight from software developer's mouths!
1289943877: <PipSqueek> 
1289943964: <tinfoil> I do pay, for Bibble Pro
1289943964: <PipSqueek> 
1289943969: <tinfoil> Worth every penny
1289943969: <PipSqueek> 
1289943985: <acr0nym> Well, paying for that is like stealing from Adobe!
1289943985: <PipSqueek> 
1289943991: <acr0nym> Communist asshole.
1289943991: <PipSqueek> 
1289943998: <tinfoil> Oh, i should go pay for a few copies
1289943998: <PipSqueek> 
1289944001: <acr0nym> Heh.
1289944001: <PipSqueek> 
1289944001: <tinfoil> a few more, I mean
1289944001: <PipSqueek> 
1289944021: <acr0nym> Heh, just to steal from Adobe?
1289944021: <PipSqueek> 
1289944042: <acr0nym> Oh, as an update for everyone who was curious:  The scp problems are 100% campus routing.
1289944042: <PipSqueek> 
1289944046: <tinfoil> Hell, the latest versions of bibble are so damn good that I'd likely use it on Win32/OSX over adobe's asset management package
1289944046: <PipSqueek> 
1289944056: <tinfoil> acr0nym: What happened?
1289944056: <PipSqueek> 
1289944065: <acr0nym> NetOps is still chasing it.
1289944065: <PipSqueek> 
1289944073: <acr0nym> But, at 7:00 a.m., I can get 8 MB/s.
1289944073: <PipSqueek> 
1289944081: <acr0nym> At noon, 300 kb/s.
1289944081: <PipSqueek> 
1289944091: <dp> tinfoil: seeing Bibble Pro reminded me, how much post do you do on your images?
1289944091: <PipSqueek> 
1289944101: <tinfoil> Why don't they pop over the router version control repository or change detection software to see what changed?
1289944101: <PipSqueek> 
1289944111: <acr0nym> HAH.
1289944111: <PipSqueek> 
1289944114: <acr0nym> I wish.
1289944114: <PipSqueek> 
1289944153: <tinfoil> dp: Depends on the shoot.  I try to get as close to ideal in the camera, but sometimes I get ideas after or sometimes I don't get the shot as ideal as possible (usually due to timing)
1289944153: <PipSqueek> 
1289944179: <tinfoil> usually though I apply white balance and color correction, thats about it
1289944179: <PipSqueek> 
1289944239: <dp> ok, as an example: http://sinisterbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/2010-02-14T13_25_09-IMG_7089_v2.jpg
1289944239: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/8$1M
1289944257: <tinfoil> That has some post :-)
1289944257: <PipSqueek> 
1289944279: <tinfoil> Added vinette and upped the saturation and contrast a little
1289944279: <PipSqueek> 
1289944280: <tinfoil> that's it
1289944280: <PipSqueek> 
1289944316: <tinfoil> I should go back to the original on that one
1289944316: <PipSqueek> 
1289944332: <tinfoil> I was fooling around, and that shouldn't have made my portfolio 
1289944332: <PipSqueek> 
1289944358: <tinfoil> I'm not too experienced on post production
1289944358: <PipSqueek> 
1289944366: <tinfoil> :-)
1289944366: <PipSqueek> 
1289944520: <tinfoil> One of the things I love bibble for is that all my edits are non-destructive, so I can roll back to default :-)
1289944520: <PipSqueek> 
1289944621: <dp> ok, this is a stupid question, but as everyone knows, my google-fu is fucking horrible; I want to know what data looks like *just* before sphinx indexes it; query suggestions?
1289944621: <PipSqueek> 
1289944721: <tinfoil> Explain?
1289944721: <PipSqueek> 
1289944799: <dp> sphinx is looping over data coming out of a database, and indexing it
1289944799: <PipSqueek> 
1289944805: <dp> I want to see the data that it's indexing
1289944805: <PipSqueek> 
1289944822: <dp> because apparently, the data I think should be being indexed might not be
1289944822: <PipSqueek> 
1289945031: <tinfoil> Oh, no clue

1290010040: <PipSqueek> 
1290010067: <dp> 6-8 months ago, I designed a system that would let our sales folks add companies to our email inventory for sends
1290010067: <PipSqueek> 
1290010084: <dp> we've now decided that we're going to continue to use the fucking excel sheet

1290010090: <dp> we're an internet company
1290010090: <PipSqueek> 
1290010096: <dp> and all we do is use fucking excel
1290010096: <PipSqueek>

1290022800: <dp> ok
1290022800: <PipSqueek> 
1290022805: <dp> new networking question
1290022805: <PipSqueek> 
1290022863: <dp> Box A has IP 10.0.0.22, default gw 10.0.0.1. pinging anything outside the private network fails. any ideas?
1290022863: <PipSqueek> 
1290022963: <tinfoil> 10.0.0.1 either a) isn't the default gateway, or b) It doesn't know that it's supposed to be a gateway, or c) knows it's a gateway, but doesn't properly have routes set up
1290022963: <PipSqueek> 
1290022986: <tinfoil> of course, traceroute would tell you more
1290022986: <PipSqueek> 
1290022991: <tinfoil> because it might not be 10.0.0.1 
1290022991: <PipSqueek> 
1290022997: <tinfoil> it could be another point that is causing errors
1290022997: <PipSqueek> 
1290023009: <tinfoil> traceroute style tools are your friend
1290023009: <PipSqueek> 
1290023040: <fbx> is traceroute still -d in nix for "no dns resolution"?
1290023040: <PipSqueek> 
1290023089: <dp> hrm. unfortunately, this box doesn't have traceroute installed, and is the only box "fully" behind the gateway
1290023089: <PipSqueek> 
1290023107: <dp> actually, wait
1290023107: <PipSqueek> 
1290023115: <dp> there might be another
1290023115: <PipSqueek> 
1290023176: <dp> yes, this other gentoo box is behind it as well
1290023176: <PipSqueek> 
1290023193: <dp> it's a livecd box ;)
1290023193: <PipSqueek> 
1290023221: <dp> tinfoil: from the inside box: http://pastebin.com/zF6zfwAH
1290023221: <PipSqueek> 
1290023261: <tinfoil> Well, then I'd be looking at 10.0.0.1
1290023261: <PipSqueek> 
1290023282: <tinfoil> it's one of the 3 options I listed above, not including d) it could also be firewalled
1290023282: <PipSqueek> 
1290023306: <tinfoil> but your problem is the last responding hop
1290023306: <PipSqueek> 
1290023312: <tinfoil> regardless what the problem is
1290023312: <PipSqueek> 
1290023378: <dp> tinfoil: hrm
1290023378: <PipSqueek> 
1290023613: <dp> ok, from the routing tables on the load balancer, it looks like it doesn't know it's supposed to be a gateway
1290023613: <PipSqueek> 
1290023626: <dp> http://pastebin.com/TjjxYpEb
1290023626: <PipSqueek> 
1290023632: <dp> thoughts?
1290023632: <PipSqueek> 
1290023647: <tinfoil> I know nothing about that kind of device
1290023647: <PipSqueek>

1290023788: <tinfoil> Most network stacks work the same - though their configuration may be convoluted by a gui

1290025706: <PipSqueek>

1290026025: <dp> kbwichan: wouldn't routes have an effect on ping?
1290026025: <PipSqueek> 
1290026067: <kbwichan> if you ping something on your local subnet, you're going direct.  not via the router
1290026067: <PipSqueek> 
1290026113: <kbwichan> now if you have multiple gateways on the same subnet it could get messy.  say 192.168.1.1 handles 1-128 and 192.168.1.129 handles 129-255 and your only route is to .1
1290026113: <PipSqueek> 
1290026128: <kbwichan> if you ping 192.168.1.222, 192.168.1.1 might send you an icmp redirect
1290026128: <PipSqueek> 
1290026150: <kbwichan> saying use 192.168.1.129 as a route instead
1290026150: <PipSqueek> 
1290026187: <kbwichan> it's not wrong but usually overcomplicated and messy to have more than one gateway in any given subnet
1290026187: <PipSqueek> 
1290026217: <kbwichan> better to know i can get anywhere i want directly within the subnet and everything else just foist off on the router

1290026328: <PipSqueek>

1290026626: <PipSqueek>

1290026633: <PipSqueek>

1290032863: <PipSqueek> 
1290032881: <]3d0g> heh, I saw your commute sucked hard this morning
1290032881: <PipSqueek> 
1290032890: <acr0nym> Oh, yeah, it was crap.
1290032890: <PipSqueek> 
1290032934: <]3d0g> you got on 104th the same time I got on e-470. We crossed paths when I went over 36 later
1290032934: <PipSqueek> 
1290032942: <acr0nym> Yep.
1290032942: <PipSqueek> 
1290032956: <acr0nym> Super slow, dunno what the deal was.  I bailed off.
1290032956: <PipSqueek> 
1290033287: <]3d0g> we had ice hell out my way. took an hour just to get to e-470.

1290033548: <tinfoil> What kind of firefly references?
1290033548: <PipSqueek> 
1290033556: <tinfoil> I haven't watched any castle yet
1290033556: <PipSqueek> 
1290033633: <acr0nym> Heh, just tiny ones.
1290033633: <PipSqueek> 
1290033659: <acr0nym> Like, the Halloween episode, Nathan Fillion dresses up as Mal.  Heh.
1290033659: <PipSqueek> 
1290033774: <tinfoil> "I was aiming for his head"
1290033774: <PipSqueek> 
1290033786: <tinfoil> Or when he speaks chinese?
1290033786: <PipSqueek>

1290033802: <acr0nym> Heh, when he speaks chinese.
1290033802: <PipSqueek> 
1290035279: <tinfoil> Somehow I was reminded of this episode (if you haven't seen it, you should) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_(Stargate_SG-1)
1290035279: <PipSqueek> URL is invalid (response was 404 Not Found)
1290035394: <tinfoil> PipSqueek: That's because your URL Regular expression is broken
1290035394: <PipSqueek> 
1290036042: <acr0nym> Yeah, I haven't watched any SG-1 yet, and see no reason to start now.
1290036042: <PipSqueek> 
1290036074: <tinfoil> That episode is worth it
1290036074: <PipSqueek>

1290036085: <PipSqueek>

1290103469: <PipSqueek> tinfoil: Still employed?
1290103491: <tinfoil> Argh... First annoyance of today is wordpress is filtering images from my RSS - AGAIN
1290103491: <PipSqueek> 
1290103494: <tinfoil> I thought I had fixed it
1290103494: <PipSqueek> 
1290103498: <tinfoil> Dammit
1290103498: <PipSqueek> 
1290103503: <tinfoil> Second annoyance
1290103503: <PipSqueek> 
1290104084: <tinfoil> I was told to create a monitoring server for our shit
1290104084: <PipSqueek> 
1290104101: <tinfoil> and I'm responsiple for the old broken one that nobody maintained, now
1290104101: <PipSqueek> 
1290104110: <tinfoil> but then I find out that someone else is also assigned the same task
1290104110: <PipSqueek> 
1290104126: <tinfoil> and as such, all my requests were denied
1290104126: <PipSqueek> 
1290104134: <tinfoil> so I'm told to do work and not allowed to do it
1290104134: <PipSqueek> 
1290104144: <tinfoil> and I'm given a product that can't be maintained
1290104144: <PipSqueek> 
1290104172: <tinfoil> It's so out of date and unmaintained that it would be a full time job to fix it
1290104172: <PipSqueek> 
1290104181: <tinfoil> Versus replacing it
1290104181: <PipSqueek> 
1290104403: <tinfoil> Seems like the left hand doesn't know what the right does around here
1290104403: <PipSqueek> 
1290104413: <tinfoil> And every time I get assigned work, I can't do it
1290104413: <PipSqueek> 
1290104707: <tinfoil> Management is fucked here
1290104707: <PipSqueek> 
1290104711: <tinfoil> and my morale is at an all time low
1290104711: <PipSqueek> 
1290104720: <tinfoil> I was looking forward to doing this project
1290104720: <PipSqueek> 
1290106856: <tinfoil> Hah... found out I did in about a week what took the other project 3 months to achieve
1290106856: <PipSqueek> 
1290106865: <tinfoil> But now I have to undo my work
1290106865: <PipSqueek> 
1290106868: <tinfoil> and let them do their job
1290106868: <PipSqueek> 
1290106924: <tinfoil> Aparently it's hard to monitor 2000 devices
1290106924: <PipSqueek> 
1290107012: <tinfoil> After 3 months of planning they are JUST turning up nagios
1290107012: <PipSqueek> 
1290107084: <tinfoil> I have trending graphs and ping/latency monitoring for several hundred devices, and if my firewall request went through I'd have all 2000
1290107084: <PipSqueek> 
1290107107: <tinfoil> I tied mine to active directory, including permissions management using AD groups
1290107107: <PipSqueek> 
1290107123: <tinfoil> (so linux admins saw linux devices, network admins saw network devices, etc etc
1290107123: <PipSqueek> 
1290107141: <tinfoil> I was in the process of setting up alerting
1290107141: <PipSqueek> 
1290107155: <tinfoil> I started last week.
1290107155: <PipSqueek>

1290122250: <tinfoil> And the weird part is, I can'f figure how out it's implemented else I'd find it in tripwire

1290185486: <PipSqueek> 
1290185585: <acr0nym> Also, side note, I thought something similar about Kari having birth.  ;)
1290185585: <PipSqueek>

1290185592: <PipSqueek>

1290185659: <dp> why don't they just stick a network port on it, and let it speak ntp?

1290185684: <PipSqueek> 
1290185687: <]3d0g> also not a terrible idea dp. It's totally re-programmable. 
1290185687: <PipSqueek> 
1290186658: <dp> I wonder how small the code is for a simple UDP stack and NTP
1290186658: <PipSqueek> 
1290186702: <dp> well, and some form of cron
1290186702: <PipSqueek> 
1290187070: <tinfoil> Full NTP would be fairly complex, but simple NTP query would be easy to generate and parse responses that match
1290187070: <PipSqueek> 
1290187139: <tinfoil> Just about any microcontroller you could connect to an ethernet transciever could do it
1290187139: <PipSqueek> 
1290187154: <tinfoil> transceiver
1290187154: <PipSqueek> 
1290187155: <tinfoil> sorry
1290187155: <PipSqueek> 
1290187186: <]3d0g> easier would be to just do a simple serial protocol to a nearby computer and have it do the ntp "heavy lifting".
1290187186: <PipSqueek> 
1290187203: <tinfoil> that's true too :-)
1290187203: <PipSqueek> 
1290187216: <tinfoil> Easier would be to get a serisl gps
1290187216: <PipSqueek> 
1290187223: <]3d0g> was just about to say that
1290187223: <PipSqueek> 
1290187233: <tinfoil> NMEA protocol includes timestamp every seconde
1290187233: <PipSqueek> 
1290187241: <tinfoil> along with GPS cords
1290187241: <PipSqueek> 
1290187254: <tinfoil> no query, just reads
1290187254: <PipSqueek> 
1290187284: <tinfoil> I was really impressed with how easy it is to get data from GPS receivers :-)
1290187284: <PipSqueek> 
1290187304: <tinfoil> Hell, even ones that can take DGPS do all the work for you
1290187304: <PipSqueek> 
1290187366: <]3d0g> couldn't resist. clock ordered.

1290187387: <PipSqueek> 
1290187660: <tinfoil> So my manager got me involved with the monitoring project - proved that the needs of the networking/security team extend well beyond what the Ops team was setting up with monitoring.  Also argued that I had so much more set up than they did, but admitted that what I setup wasn't ideal for the ops teams needs (to not stop on their toes)
1290187660: <PipSqueek> 
1290187708: <tinfoil> Between those two arguments, I can continue on my own, but I need to integrate alerts with them

1290190091: <PipSqueek>

1290460249: <PipSqueek> 
1290460299: <tinfoil> The popular thing for men in Seattle is to wear a utilikilt without underwear through TSA

1290460307: <PipSqueek> 
1290460352: <tinfoil> Utilikilt is based out of Seattle, so they are regular wear for lots of people here

1291049776: <tinfoil> good holiday weekend?
1291049776: <PipSqueek> 
1291049782: <]3d0g> indeed
1291049782: <PipSqueek> 
1291049822: <tinfoil> I spent most of the week since Tuesday at home.  it feels good to be out
1291049822: <PipSqueek> 
1291049881: <tinfoil> Out of lack of anything to watch while there, I decided to break down and watch Stargate Universe, which pleasently surprised me.  So far it's the only good stargate series.  (not great, but surprisingly good)
1291049881: <PipSqueek> 
1291050593: <dp> oi!
1291050593: <PipSqueek> 
1291050665: <]3d0g> I got caught up on Mythbusters, watched a bunch of the Bond-a-thon Friday, and played video games.
1291050665: <PipSqueek> 
1291050702: <tinfoil> Oh, I need to see if netflix can stream mythbusters yet
1291050702: <PipSqueek> 
1291050817: <]3d0g> I don't believe mythbusters has ever been done to DVD in series sets.
1291050817: <PipSqueek> 
1291050834: <]3d0g> they do collections of shows. they are on streaming though.
1291050834: <PipSqueek> 
1291050940: <tinfoil> I'm still annoyed with GoodEats on DVD - aside from a couple seasons, you have to buy almost all of the show in one big set
1291050940: <PipSqueek>

1291052373: <acr0nym> Man, I have some real trepidation about "Tron Legacy".
1291052373: <PipSqueek> 
1291052408: <tinfoil> How come?
1291052408: <PipSqueek> 
1291052432: <acr0nym> It just strikes me as some possibility of just being another lousy action flick.
1291052432: <PipSqueek> 
1291052454: <tinfoil> I find it amusing that disney is so money grubing that they held off releasing Tron on DVD until Legacy comes out on DVD
1291052454: <PipSqueek> 
1291052475: <acr0nym> Well, not releasing, two versions are out on DVD.  It just vanished from shelves.
1291052475: <PipSqueek> 
1291052478: <tinfoil> The possibility is there
1291052478: <PipSqueek> 
1291052486: <tinfoil> True
1291052486: <PipSqueek> 
1291052502: <tinfoil> Not releasing in recent times
1291052502: <PipSqueek> 
1291052515: <tinfoil> No rentals  available
1291052515: <PipSqueek> 
1291052525: <tinfoil> I bet its on a torrent somewhere
1291052525: <PipSqueek> 
1291052550: <acr0nym> Almost undoubtedly.  I have a DVDShrink somewhere of the 20th anniversary DVD, both discs, if you need it.
1291052550: <PipSqueek> 
1291052553: <acr0nym> Heh.
1291052553: <PipSqueek> 
1291052860: <]3d0g> I echo acr0's concern. I'll be shocked if this flick is even remotely worthy. 
1291052860: <PipSqueek> 
1291053078: <tinfoil> I give it 80% chance of being fun, 50% chance of being good, 20% chance of actually being a awesome
1291053078: <PipSqueek> 
1291053092: <tinfoil> fun != satisfying, but not horrid
1291053092: <PipSqueek> 
1291055747: <tinfoil> It's funny how users react when they hear a new technology being implemented
1291055747: <PipSqueek> 
1291055760: <hoamchan> bury head in sand and deny it
1291055760: <PipSqueek> 
1291055798: <tinfoil> we started getting tickets from users having connectivity issues - the reason?  Websense is causing the issues, and security is responsiple for websense
1291055798: <PipSqueek> 
1291055801: <tinfoil> The thing is
1291055801: <PipSqueek> 
1291055809: <tinfoil> We haven't put websense inline yet

1291055849: <tinfoil> not the episode, though

1291057437: <]3d0g> This weekend clearly showed the whiners about the new policy are a tiny minority. The mindless masses are quite satisfied and even impressed with the new TSA Security theater. 
1291057437: <PipSqueek> 
1291057483: <tinfoil> We had a long discussion here in the office
1291057484: <PipSqueek> 
1291057524: <tinfoil> the result was that if airport security was doing it's job it wouldn't allow any masses of people to gather anywhere prior to being screened
1291057524: <PipSqueek> 
1291057575: <tinfoil> Great, you're keeping people with bombs from getting on a plane... but there are hundreds of people in tight zig-zagged lines to be screened... what's to stop someone from harming them?
1291057575: <PipSqueek> 
1291057598: <tinfoil> And you know what - that would create a huge amount of terror
1291057598: <PipSqueek> 
1291057628: <tinfoil> Fucking fix the problem
1291057628: <PipSqueek> 
1291057634: <]3d0g> yup. one of the big reasons I'm in favor of the backscatter scans. if they can (and should) speed up the process, lines should be non-existent and flight check-in more predictable.

1291057809: <dp> doesn't matter
1291057809: <PipSqueek>

1291062735: <hoamchan> millimeter wave is a lot safer than xray based machines though.  if your equipment emits ionizing radiation at people, you best be a fucking licensed radiologic technician to operate it

1291065330: <hoamchan> altitutde radiation isn't tuned frequencies.  at the same power level, most passed completely through your entire body.  backscatter is tuned frequencies which means at the same power level, the vast majority of radiations energy is absorbed by only your skin

1291065840: <hoamchan> Radiation is unique in that it cannot be detected by sight, touch, smell, hearing or taste. Its proper use can save lives but its abuse may ultimately harm patients. Because of this inherent risk, it is every patient's right to have their radiographic procedure performed by licensed radiologic technologists who are knowledgeable of the proper techniques and the associated risks of involved in these procedures.
1291065840: <PipSqueek> 
1291065845: <hoamchan> It is this very concept that prompted the New Jersey legislature in 1968 to pass the Radiologic Technologist Act (Act) which requires all operators of medical ionizing radiation producing equipment to be licensed. New Jersey was the second state to pass this much needed legislation. To date, 35 states and Puerto Rico have enacted legislation that requires radiologic technologists to be licensed. Additionally, 28 states license radiation ther

1291219648: <acr0nym> Sherpas, or something else?
1291219685: <dp> mmmm
1291219693: <dp> sites using the load balancer
1291219708: <dp> but, that means I can't use that box for crunching any more
1291220247: <]3d0g> yeah, most likely sherpa again, but I want to try the Colorados too.
1291220282: <acr0nym> Are the lenses on the Sherpa actually perfectly round?
1291220370: <]3d0g> not the ones I got
1291220393: <acr0nym> Hrmm.  That's what I'm after, and I thought I saw some.
1291220401: <]3d0g> you looking for like what Jamie wears on mythbusters?
1291220451: <acr0nym> Uh, don't remember.  Heh.
1291220484: <acr0nym> Yeah, sort of.
1291220490: <acr0nym> Which, are obviously Julbo.

1291220512: <acr0nym> Since you can read their name in that picture.
1291220643: <]3d0g> ah, interesting. Older shows he was wearing some that were perfectly round. they caught my eye and I'd gone surfing for them at one point.

1291220797: <acr0nym> "Sold Out".
1291220798: <acr0nym> Heh.
1291220847: <acr0nym> Fuck it, I have a pair of these: http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Motorcycle-Motorbike-Interchangeable-Steampunk/dp/B0019AI6RO/ref=pd_sbs_a_24

1291220864: <]3d0g> heh, don't your eyes get hot in those?
1291220873: <acr0nym> Well, they're vented some.
1291220876: <]3d0g> ah
1291220885: <acr0nym> And, no, it doesn't seem like "Julbo Round" are made.

1291220933: <]3d0g> but sqare on, as in that Jamie pic, you can tell they're not
1291220937: <acr0nym> Yep.
1291220955: <]3d0g> takes the right shape head to pull off full round too. 
1291220968: <acr0nym> Right, but, I suspect I have that .  Heh.

1291221360: <]3d0g> hmm, not noticed those before
1291221387: <]3d0g> REI clearly has the best local Julbo selection. Just need to get my ass down there.
1291221423: <acr0nym> Yeah, I may run to the Boulder store today.
1291221424: <acr0nym> Heh.
1291221478: <]3d0g> never been to it. big as the main downtown one?

1291222417: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: You do anything with OS X as a terminal (SSH) seriver?
1291222453: <]3d0g> got my air set up so I can ssh in, that what you mean?
1291222478: <acr0nym> Bigger scale, like, actual multiple users ssh'ing to it.
1291222487: <]3d0g> ah, no
1291222490: <acr0nym> Okey dokey.
1291222505: <acr0nym> There's a guy on campus having troubles, and I strongly suspect that OS X just isn't designed that way.
1291222517: <acr0nym> Multiple users who SSH in, but have a homedir on a different machine, that kind of thing.
1291222587: <]3d0g> nfs homes?
1291222603: <acr0nym> AFP, I think.
1291222621: <]3d0g> can't think of anything that would prevent it, but not a path I've needed to go down
1291222664: <acr0nym> Problem 1: First user ssh's into replica machine, no problem.  
1291222665: <acr0nym> All other users with home directories on the same disk are 
1291222665: <acr0nym> locked out.  Appears that the mount point of the home 
1291222665: <acr0nym> directories is owned by that first user.  How do I get it so I 
1291222665: <acr0nym> can have multiple users with home directories on a common disk 
1291222665: <acr0nym> get in via ssh?
1291222760: <]3d0g> do all users have accounts set up in System/Accounts?
1291222790: <acr0nym> They're using Open Directory:
1291222791: <acr0nym> Setup (as before): OD master mac server has home directories, OD 
1291222791: <acr0nym> replica Mac server has some other disks, one of which is shared 
1291222791: <acr0nym> and set to allow automount.
1291222797: <]3d0g> I know you can't just slap 'em in /etc/password with different home dirs
1291222826: <]3d0g> way out of my expertise, sorry,.
1291222838: <acr0nym> Yeah, me, too.  Heh.
1291222850: <acr0nym> And, I don't think I have access to enough machines to do any testing.
1291222873: <acr0nym> However, I'm also wildly not sure why you'd use OSX this way....
1291222874: <acr0nym> Heh.
1291222904: <]3d0g> when you have a hammer, the whole fucking world looks a lot like a nail.
1291222936: <acr0nym> Thanks, Big Blue.

1291223016: <acr0nym> Riiiight.
1291223023: <acr0nym> Just like you're there to help your lusers.
1291223378: <acr0nym> It seems like an Audi R8 would indeed be a lot of fun to drive.
1291223527: <]3d0g> indeed
1291223538: <]3d0g> getting the new car itch?
1291223563: <acr0nym> Heh, no, watching a Nat. Geo. "Ultimate Car Factories" show on it.
1291223621: <acr0nym> And, it's going to be a LONG time, or a big-ass Powerball win before I get an itch for a car priced over $100K.
1291223906: <]3d0g> no kidding
1291225035: <acr0nym> And, then, realistically, it'd prolly be a Bugatti.  I like the styling.
1291225036: <acr0nym> Heh.
1291228680: <dp> mmmmm... kfc doubledown
1291228720: <]3d0g> got the cardiac doc on speed-dial?
1291228750: <dp> bah
1291228758: <dp> gonna die anyway
1291228765: <dp> might as well eat tasty food on the way
1291228774: <]3d0g> go out well lubricated.

1291307471: <acr0nym> No, I don't think it started until yesterday.

1291319486: <acr0nym> Watching it now.

1291326741: <TeleCon> Stopping and getting an el cheapo 720p 32 inch lcd tv on the way
1291326747: <acr0nym> How much?
1291326751: <TeleCon> 298?
1291326754: <TeleCon> I think?
1291326756: <acr0nym> Cool, where?
1291326760: <TeleCon> wally world
1291326767: <acr0nym> Groovy.
1291326777: <TeleCon> Ideally it would have been best buy, but best price for the apparant quality.
1291326778: <acr0nym> Vizio?
1291326782: <TeleCon> yeah, actually
1291326793: <TeleCon> I think it might be last years model.
1291326798: <TeleCon> But seems OK stat wise.
1291326809: <TeleCon> Unplanned so cheaper is better.
1291326820: <acr0nym> Heh.
1291326880: <TeleCon> And I don't think we have anything that will do better than 720p anyway.
1291326887: <TeleCon> So why get 1080p for now.
1291326890: <acr0nym> Yeah.
1291326945: <TeleCon> And I don't need a connected tv, since I have a little box for that.
1291326953: <acr0nym> Which box?
1291326998: <TeleCon> Can't remember now.
1291327013: <acr0nym> Did you build an XBMC?
1291327022: <TeleCon> No, bought something.
1291327023: <acr0nym> It'll do 720p fairly painlessly.
1291327024: <acr0nym> Ah.
1291327025: <TeleCon> No dvd, just net.
1291327028: <acr0nym> Gotcha.
1291327094: <TeleCon> Maybe roku?
1291327100: <acr0nym> Maybe.
1291327108: <TeleCon> I'll look at the box when I get home.
1291327118: <acr0nym> I'm considering a Boxee load on a little HD capable pc thing.
1291327131: <TeleCon> Oh yeah, it's a roku.
1291327145: <TeleCon> Wanted something to do netflix upstairs, so the wii could go down.
1291327155: <acr0nym> Groovy.
1291327168: <TeleCon> aight.  ttyl
1291327172: <acr0nym> Actually, come to think of it, if I can find the right mini PC, with HDMI, I might just do XBMC on it.
1291327175: <acr0nym> Heh.
1291327190: <TeleCon> :)
1291327203: <TeleCon> yeah, this was a quick easy solution.
1291327209: <TeleCon> For just streaming stuff.
1291327622: <acr0nym> Hrm.  I don't like the new Theme for Wooting Off.
1291339296: <TeleCon> Um
1291339300: <TeleCon> New theme?
1291385172: <hoamchan> crissakes these people don't understand the osi stack
1291385252: <hoamchan> they're talking about redesigning their entire network because hosts are showing up in a logging tool with the "wrong" ip addresses.  these ip addresses are in networks that are being used elsewhere
1291385268: <hoamchan> that absolutely shouldn't (and don't) route publicly
1291385296: <hoamchan> they can't get that that if the packets got from point A to point B, then they used the right path, the right source address
1291385342: <hoamchan> they can't get that the source ip address in layer 3 is different from what the name/ip in the layer 7 data/message is saying

1291385921: <hoamchan> injection potential?

1291643550: <hoamchan> yes theres and example in there with eterm
1291643569: <dp> can you pastebin it? I don't have the sample handy
1291643569: <hoamchan> "Eterm" NULL exec "Eterm -t MySpiffE"
1291643575: <dp> ah, ok
1291643596: <hoamchan> name icon exec "commandline"
1291643618: <dp> awesome,. got it working

1291643642: <hoamchan> never tried
1291643662: <hoamchan> how about single ticks 'Eterm -t "param"'
1291643677: <dp> that doesn't seem to work either
1291643750: <hoamchan> could always make a shell script and drop it in /usr/local/bin

1291645883: <dp> I've cleaned up my music folder about a hundred times, but it never seems to get "better"
1291646164: <dp> so, it's time to try to do something about that
1291646535: <hoamchan> ignore the problem?
1291646575: <dp> hard to ignore 50+ G of problem
1291646978: <hoamchan> sure you can
1291647000: <hoamchan> that's what these things called folders are for.  make one called dump and just bury everything in it

1291647226: <hoamchan> got me feeling all insecure though.  i've only got about 15G

1291653905: <]3d0g> bah, go kelvin. all the cool kids are doing it.
1291654090: <hoamchan> wondering how cold i can set it overnight
1291654098: <hoamchan> and not freak out or get woken up by it
1291654131: <]3d0g> get an electric blanket and go nuts. 
1291654193: <hoamchan> is that more efficient than heating the whole house
1291654200: <]3d0g> lord yes
1291654207: <hoamchan> really.  i never used one before
1291654295: <]3d0g> Costs about a quarter to run an electric blanket for 10 hours.
1291654476: <hoamchan> the cats would love that
1291654486: <]3d0g> oh, they do.
1291654509: <]3d0g> the blanket we have has individual controls. the cats gravitate to whichever side is on :)
1291654527: <hoamchan> that's one of the reasons i say the cats are not a cost center
1291654528: <]3d0g> meaning it's a big pile-on on me @ night
1291654534: <hoamchan> rock
1291654596: <]3d0g> seriously, I wish I'd have gotten an electric blanket LONG ago. Had it about 2 months now and I'm sleeping so much better. Didn't realize I was getting cold in the wee hours and it was impacting my sleep.
1291654676: <hoamchan> good idea thanks.  trying to figure out how to massively reduce costs.  not that it's required but just because it's the right thing to do environmentally AND saves money
1291654710: <acr0nym> I think I have it set for 64 overnight.
1291654738: <hoamchan> i do 62 around the clock.  really need a programmable thermo replacement here
1291654975: <dp> I think I might force the wife to use an electric blanket
1291654984: <dp> I have one blanket; she has 4
1291654988: <dp> and she still gets cold

1291743074: <tinfoil> Oh damn, so it's only url's I create
1291743107: <tinfoil> url's for my site by default will not get sbr.cx
1291743129: <tinfoil> but since my site is now registering new url's with bitly, all new articles should get it
1291743670: <tinfoil> Almost done configuring bit.ly for sinisterbrain.com / sbr.cx
1291744344: <tinfoil> just manually added all my sitemap.xml urls
1291744352: <tinfoil> wheee :-)
1291744513: <dp> tinfoil: you generating them automagically?
1291744581: <tinfoil> perl
1291744648: <tinfoil> http://sbr.cx/hQjOiP+   for stats or http://bit.ly/hQjOiP for the url
1291744648: <PipSqueek> http://bit.ly/hQjOiP -- Weather sinisterbrain
1291744648: <dp> it's just wordpress, right?
1291744648: <tinfoil> Any new page I put on my site will be created automagicly via wordpress
1291744660: <tinfoil> interesting
1291744665: <dp> http://www.arnebrachhold.de/projects/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps-generator/
1291744667: <dp> check that one out
1291744684: <tinfoil> It's already installed
1291744695: <tinfoil> That's how I generated my sitemaps
1291744715: <dp> k
1291744722: <tinfoil> used perl to parse the url's out of that and submit all my existing url's to bit.ly
1291744728: <dp> ah
1291744754: <tinfoil> Biy.ly offered some decent metrics for free
1291744760: <tinfoil> figured I might as well try it
1291744857: <tinfoil> Since I left tumblr, went wordpress, went SEO, and started producing better images my stats are almost 200% higher than last month
1291744916: <tinfoil> registered with google, yahoo, msn(bing), and ask as a webmaster
1291744930: <tinfoil> wordpress pings them when it's updated
1291744938: <tinfoil> pretty cool :-)
1291745327: <tinfoil> Need to produce better articles now
1291749167: <dp> ok
1291749195: <dp> I need to figure out a way to push content to my different servers
1291749198: <dp> without ssh
1291749202: <dp> without rsync
1291749208: <dp> light, fast
1291749346: <]3d0g> sftp?
1291749400: <dp> that could work. though I don't need any encryption
1291749407: <dp> it's all local net
1291749413: <]3d0g> tftp - even easier
1291749420: <dp> ever used it?
1291749443: <]3d0g> tftp? of course. anyone who's managed routers pretty much lives by it.
1291749560: <acr0nym> Isn't tftp what the first really big worm exploited?  Heh.
1291749585: <]3d0g> well, he said he didn't need encryption
1291749634: <dp> it will be IP limited
1291750025: <tinfoil> git or svn
1291750050: <tinfoil> I used used it for website content distribution before
1291750054: <tinfoil> cvs, actually
1291750074: <tinfoil> git would be great, as if you did it right it would keep an archive of production content on all relevent machines... makes DR much easier
1291750132: <tinfoil> Had a branch for production data, I'd check data into it, and would have my servers check out the latest version on a regular interval.
1291750179: <tinfoil> Also had a nice defacement resistance as if you overwrote any files, they would be corrected at the next checkout
1291750207: <dp> I need it to be instantaneous
1291750218: <dp> need to be able to push constantly
1291750247: <tinfoil> NFS
1291750251: <tinfoil> :-p

1291750275: <dp> it fucking *drags*

1291750283: <tinfoil> We're doing it here for a project
1291750288: <tinfoil> it pissed me off to find that out
1291750297: <tinfoil> because they put up 20+ redundant servers
1291750301: <tinfoil> and 1 nfs server

1291754856: <fbx> general feeling on wikileaks publishing those govt docs?
1291754893: <tinfoil> though I saw a great tweet yesterday.   something along the lines of "Sarah Palin says they should hunt down Julian Assange like Osama bin Laden - he should be safe for a few years in that case."
1291754894: <]3d0g> generally good.
1291754918: <tinfoil> I think wikileaks is playing their cards right
1291754945: <tinfoil> what they released is redacted and somewhat low priority messages
1291754955: <tinfoil> they are showing some sensitivitity
1291754961: <]3d0g> yup
1291754976: <tinfoil> The government's reaction is _VERY_ overblown
1291754981: <fbx> well, sure
1291755001: <]3d0g> shit like this keeps governments accountable for their actions.
1291755015: <fbx> it's the equiv of publishing everything that happens here to folks who might be mentioned in here in a negative light
1291755022: <tinfoil> Here's the deal... those files are already distributed to the people who want them (ie - foreign intelligence), they just are not public.  I'd bet on it.
1291755074: <dp> here's my thought: if you don't want it published, don't save it
1291755077: <tinfoil> they are looking to burn wikileaks to scare others from doing the same thing, not to stop the release of information
1291755083: <tinfoil> Scapegoat
1291755091: <dp> tinfoil: did you see the wikileaks mirror project?

1291837781: <dp> I bet those would make a fuckall railgun
1291837790: <tinfoil> dp:   Ohhhhhhhhh!
1291837796: <fbx> i like black
1291837807: <tinfoil> dp:  My only worry is that at some point they get so much energy they break
1291837816: <dp> tinfoil: that is possible
1291837817: <tinfoil> dp:  but that would be fun to do!
1291837830: <dp> I wonder how much it would take to break a small RE magnet like that
1291837962: <tinfoil> Sounds like an experiment is in order
1291838008: <fbx> break how?
1291838190: <dp> crack
1291838193: <dp> disintegrate

1291838489: <tinfoil> added 10 to my cart, no discount.  Not bulk enough :-)
1291838499: <fbx> they are 20 per pack, with a multipack discount it says
1291838522: <fbx> use coupon BULKRATE at checkout
1291838579: <fbx> 10 packs for me with coupon is $20.20
1291838598: <]3d0g> considering this is DX, the coupon code should be BULKWAIT.

1291920633: <tinfoil> Microsoft and Apple are in the same boat

1291925685: <TeleCon> I think I might end up having to wipe.
1291925696: <TeleCon> Went to cyan 6.1 and a few things are not working as well.
1291925761: <hoamchan> did you do the 5.12.00.08 radio?
1291925774: <TeleCon> Yeah. Doesn't seem to make much dif though.
1291925778: <hoamchan> i just tested that with 6.0 and it seems ok
1291925786: <hoamchan> upstream is faster here
1291925811: <TeleCon> It's definitely not HSPA+ though.
1291925829: <hoamchan> did you see how to get the fm radio working?
1291925836: <TeleCon>  no
1291925842: <TeleCon> Don't need it.
1291925846: <hoamchan> that was something interested i wanted to poke at
1291925864: <TeleCon> No interest at all.
1291925879: <TeleCon> About the only time I would listen to fm is in the car, and I already got one there.
1291926161: <hoamchan> ok there's no reason to partition SD anymore with froyo?
1291926171: <TeleCon> I don't think so.
1291926178: <hoamchan> if so i'm going to zero it out
1291926199: <hoamchan> i was running out of main memory with 6.0
1291926208: <hoamchan> even with moving just about all apps to sd
1291926210: <TeleCon> Yeah, you can just move apps to sd
1291926985: <hoamchan> here goes 6.1

1292000202: <hoamchan> Based on a 2008 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the TSA and its maintenance contractors failed in the past to detect when some X-ray machines used on baggage emitted radiation beyond what regulations allow. The report shows some machines were missing protective lead curtains or had safety features disabled by TSA employees with duct tape, paper towels and other materials.

1292259992: <]3d0g> acr0nym - got my Ice Cube clock built Saturday. What a great little kit.
1292260176: <acr0nym> Nice!
1292260238: <]3d0g> All through-hole but incredibly dense. Excellent way to refresh those dusty soldering skills. Thank god for magnifying glasses :)
1292260260: <acr0nym> Did you get one of the magnifying lamps?
1292260341: <]3d0g> not yet but I did get one of these with the clock order: http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=8&products_id=291
1292260342: <]3d0g> did the job
1292260668: <acr0nym> Ah, nice.
1292260829: <]3d0g> Next up, an AVR programmer and a mod to have it display POSIX time :)
1292260845: <acr0nym> I have an AVR programmer....
1292260889: <]3d0g> 6-pin ISP?
1292260897: <acr0nym> Yep.
1292260915: <]3d0g> Hmm, I might have to borrow that.
1292260972: <acr0nym> Although, doesn't work for crap, apparently, on Linux.
1292260977: <acr0nym> Might need my machine with it.  Heh.
1292260996: <acr0nym> Are you working next week?

1292261025: <]3d0g> 20th - 22nd.
1292261037: <acr0nym> I'm not.  We could arrange for you to swing by the Matthouse, if you like.

1292261062: <]3d0g> Not a bad idea. Need to snag my dog tag anyway.
1292261064: <acr0nym> It's the minimized version of the one you linked to.
1292261080: <acr0nym> Pretty much USBtinyISP can be very painful on Linux, from what I can tell.

1292265331: <acr0nym> That makes sense.
1292265364: <tinfoil> Mibbit was really good, but the huge header was unreasonable and took up 1/2 of my window (I like keeping my non-work browser fairly small)

1292265517: <dp> jesus. authenticating to Google via OAuth is painful
1292265611: <tinfoil> How so?
1292265639: <dp> well, if you pass in oob as the value to some parameter, then you have to reauth everytime
1292265655: <tinfoil> interesting
1292265660: <dp> and apparently, being authed, I'm not really authed, because I get an Unauthorized response every time
1292265675: <dp> and to test this shit, I have to download oacurl, which is written in java
1292265685: <dp> but to actually run oacurl, I have to install maven
1292265692: <dp> which has about 600M of dependancies
1292265711: <dp> and then building with maven, this fucker has to download all of it's dependancies as well
1292265764: <fbx> tinfoil: great user photos, especially the "zap/nuclear" one
1292265786: <tinfoil> fbx: The size/price are worth it (if the pictures were real)
1292265795: <dp> also, selling shit on amazon could make you more money than selling at a bookstore
1292265799: <fbx> yeah, that's pretty spendy
1292265813: <tinfoil> I love the notes added to the death star image
1292265848: <fbx> not bad high ISO...hehe
1292265927: <fbx> we just got a new P&S for the wife
1292265935: <fbx> panasonic dmc-fh20
1292265949: <fbx> pretty nice for a $140 camera
1292265950: <tinfoil> how do you like it?
1292265955: <fbx> easy to use
1292265959: <tinfoil> Sample images, or it didn't happen.  ;-)

1292266254: <fbx> sorry to disappoint
1292266279: <fbx> also - this just in - my built-in lens on the old sony i had is falling apart
1292266302: <fbx> so i've got the fe2 and her new fh20 to shoot with...
1292267566: <tinfoil> I think sony is an annogram for "crap"
1292268014: <]3d0g> has been for many years.
1292268204: <acr0nym> Heh, Anthony Hopkins is a good choice for Odin.
1292268579: --- hoamchan is now known as ewrchan
1292268807: <fbx> that camera lasted almost nine years. still takes pictures. i just can't figure out how the manual focus ring is now hanging on by a thread...odd.
1292268855: <fbx> either way, i think the fh20 will take its place easily
1292269558: <ewrchan> talked to one of the tsa supervisors today.  EWR staff pushed back against more xray devices
1292269568: <ewrchan> they did get some of the l3 milimeter wave ones though
1292269593: <ewrchan> "expensive toys.  we have no idea when we're going to train on them"
1292269633: <ewrchan> so right now they're sitting roped off
1292269653: <fbx> nice
1292269668: <fbx> i'd say "your tax dollars at work", but...
1292269708: <ewrchan> i get to test out the new trusted entry program this week
1292269738: <ewrchan> coming back from toronto friday.  i'll be able to scan in and register at a kiosk.  fingerprints + passport = go
1292269772: <ewrchan> if it works, i'll be able to waltz into the country from abroad without having to be molested, yet i can't fly to cleveland without getting my junk squeezed
1292269779: <fbx> they trust you? man....wtf?
1292269781: <fbx> ;)
1292269787: <ewrchan> i'm pretty boring yo
1292269808: <ewrchan> good fico score, no arrests, former security clearance.  my interview was more a shoot the shit session
1292269826: <ewrchan> they grilled the other guy hard though.  he does a lot of travel to less friendly countries though
1292269831: <fbx> hey - you probably have more secrets in your head from comsat-intel days that foreigns would like to get ahold of
1292269881: <ewrchan> not really.  the only thing that was cleared back then was tracking and tasking data.  nothing in my head is timely or of any value anymore
1292271894: <tinfoil> Didn't they have that trusted entry type system for TSA a while back?
1292271904: <acr0nym> "Clear"
1292271928: <tinfoil> Did it get changed to "Opaque"?
1292271937: <acr0nym> Heh, as I recall, it went bankrupt.
1292271952: <tinfoil> Their website is still up
1292271966: <]3d0g> It was bought and is re-starting.
1292271967: <tinfoil> ewrchan: you did clear for a while, eh?
1292271992: <ewrchan> i still do
1292271993: <tinfoil> Everytime one of my co-workers goes on vacation, he comes back and finds that we moved offices
1292272003: <tinfoil> ewrchan: How well does it work?
1292272003: <]3d0g> Love how a completely private enterprise can bypass security for a $$$.
1292272051: <ewrchan> wait which clear
1292272065: <tinfoil> You hear they are looking at expanding TSA to train and bus terminals?
1292272075: <acr0nym> And Wal-Mart.
1292272079: <]3d0g> heh
1292272095: <]3d0g> They
1292272103: <]3d0g> They'll never get trains.
1292272116: <]3d0g> That's the single advantage Amtrak has.
1292272117: <ewrchan> americans are morons because they actually believe they live in the best country in the world and they dont TRAVEL to confirm this belief
1292272182: <ewrchan> travel is one of the things that you need to seriously form an opinion about anything
1292272184: <tinfoil> Belief doesn't require confirmation, ask every state between california and new jersey
1292272318: <tinfoil> oh, so according to the "clear" website, it only works in 2 airports
1292272321: <tinfoil> ORlando and Denver
1292272368: <tinfoil> That's ... effective.  :-p
1292272407: <ewrchan> yah it bothers me that the TSA has no clue who i am.  the ID checkers aren't plugged into terminals like border patrol and customs is
1292272440: <ewrchan> TSA can effectively only confirm i look like the pic on the doc i gave them
1292272456: <tinfoil> I read a good article on how Isreal does airport security
1292272488: <tinfoil> Their goal is to do character profiling, and to not let anyone pool up in large groups until after they pass all the security checkpoints
1292272498: <ewrchan> yep
1292272529: <ewrchan> the only reason they haven't blown up a TSA checkpoint yet is they know how much they piss off the traveling public
1292272539: <tinfoil> I don't even want to know how our government would react to someone bombing a security checkpoint line here.
1292272556: <ewrchan> it would be the best thing really
1292272571: <tinfoil> Potentially
1292272587: <tinfoil> After what I've observed in the last 8 years, I have no faith
1292272631: <ewrchan> they need to bring the dogs and soldiers back to the entry way
1292272647: <ewrchan> that's about your only chance against a checkpoint attack
1292272658: <ewrchan> they had them for about 5 years after 9/11
1292272713: <]3d0g> The counterpoint I've heard (from an Israeli) is their process is quite time consuming and they've only got 2 airports and very few international flights. They didn't think the process would work here.
1292272736: <tinfoil> Possibly true
1292272747: <tinfoil> but our airports could be designed to be a little more secure
1292272751: <ewrchan> yah israel won't scale
1292272876: <tinfoil> Ultimately, good security would require a change in how airports operate
1292272890: <]3d0g> I think considerable screening could be done pre check-in. Hell, if computers can sniff out potentially fraudulent charges on my card, they should be able to assess risk based on the traveler. 
1292272911: <ewrchan> yep
1292272923: <]3d0g> If you're assessed low-risk, your boarding pass gets flagged for a simple cursory TSA check and away you go.
1292272925: <tinfoil> Does the person buying the ticket have a credit history (good or bad?)
1292272936: <tinfoil> Are they suspect fradulent charges?
1292272939: <tinfoil> etc etc
1292272949: <tinfoil> If not, flag them
1292272956: <ewrchan> so for "contact points' today - the woman at the bag check kiosk did not even look at my ID.  all checked bags are xrayed at least
1292272986: <ewrchan> TSA is not tied into a terminal to confirm a) i was the one that just checked a bag, and 2) my credentials i'm showing are actually legit
1292273045: <ewrchan> to 3dogs point - they should know something's fishy the moment you make your reservation.  the entire security aparatus should queue you into the proper lines to handle whatever level of (non)suspicion
1292273095: <tinfoil> Agreed
1292273111: <tinfoil> TSA's largest source of intel would be data mining
1292273139: <tinfoil> Their intel now?  None.
1292273154: <ewrchan> lack of credit or any history would mean a thorough going over.  someone like me, they should see i'm already registered for goes entry program
1292273169: <ewrchan> held security clearances, etc
1292273203: <ewrchan> they should make sure i'm the same person they have on record and then let me through with minimal hassle
1292273263: <ewrchan> i fly all the time.  i know how to get through with minimal hassle.  i'm very low risk of anything unless you grab my balls.  if you do, the main risk is getting a dollar handed to you and hug
1292273286: <tinfoil> hah
1292273294: <ewrchan> having to sit and watch morons fumble with the whole process is painful and a waste of my time
1292273308: <tinfoil> ewrchan: Can I quote that (anonymously)?
1292273329: <ewrchan> what where who

1292273386: <ewrchan> hell they should get the girls from stilettos to lapdance ya for your patdown
1292273397: <ewrchan> "um sir, that's a very small gun you're carrying"
1292273410: <tinfoil> "Yeah, but it only shoots blanks"
1292273420: <tinfoil> Can I quote you on that?  :-)
1292273522: <tinfoil> The grabbing the balls quote
1292273523: <ewrchan> no
1292273616: <ewrchan> another thing they're doing completely wrong is letting the screening be seen from an unsecured location
1292273640: <ewrchan> terminal C EWR has three checkpoints.  i scope each one out for a few minutes before deciding which one i want to use
1292273675: <ewrchan> i look for lack hassle.  if they're giving people extra BS, i go to a different line
1292273682: <ewrchan> lack of hassle
1292273838: <ewrchan> i've even used the proles line when it looks like it's going faster than elite

1292345102: <tinfoil> dp:  The issue is that the url parser needs to be structured, and it's a regular expression which is more of a lexical parser vs a structured parser

1292360409: <]3d0g> yup. damn near zero fact checking there.
1292360442: <]3d0g> There were many twitter accounts posting as Anon. That's the wrong one.
1292360453: <acr0nym> Ah.
1292360465: <acr0nym> Did they have any luck taking down Amazon?
1292360485: <]3d0g> While some anon DID want to target Amazon, those controlling hivemind didn't and never pointed it at Amazon. 
1292360491: <acr0nym> Ah.
1292360522: <]3d0g> They were A. afraid they didn't have the numbers, and B. didn't want to impact mommy buying their christmas presents.
1292360532: <acr0nym> Hah!  Good plan.
1292360544: <fbx> 24x7 news channels: the death of western democracy lies therein.
1292360621: <]3d0g> I monitored the anon stuff pretty closely, but jeesus - they're just 4chan kids with a shitty tool (LOIC). All it took was a fresh camwhore on /b/ to distract the majority of them from their "cause". 
1292360655: <]3d0g> Still, the fact they made the top story on the evening news is a glimpse of things to come.
1292360898: <fbx> The attack itself isn't sophisticated. It's the equivalent of simply hitting the "refresh" button on a website thousands of times, which attackers use automated programs to do.
1292360909: <fbx> great...uh...low tech reference there
1292360939: <]3d0g> yup. If they'd have bothered to use something that could SYN flood, their power would have been 1,000 fold.
1292361129: <]3d0g> And amazon would have fallen like a rock.
1292361161: <fbx> but...but...they've got EC2!
1292361164: * fbx snores
1292361342: <]3d0g> I wouldn't under-estimate amazon's infrastructure. it's designed to handle SYN attacks, but a large enough source could still saturate all their load balancers. I'd also put SOLID money on amazon doing straight log dumps of all data prior to it hitting the balancers so any /b/tard thinking there's safety in numbers better leave the welcome mat out for the partyvan.

1292453879: <tinfoil> wonderful.  
1292453906: <tinfoil> We hired contractor who copied files to dropbox
1292453917: <tinfoil> he added members of his team to the dropbox
1292453928: <tinfoil> they added people they knew, etc etc
1292453933: <tinfoil> one of them was fired
1292453964: <tinfoil> next thing we know we get someone we know contacting us asking why our files are out in the wild
1292453976: <tinfoil> The nice thing is, dropbox kept all the logs
1292453994: <tinfoil> tells who invited who and when, what files they touched, etc

1292524668: <]3d0g> you sir, win today's internet.
1292524691: <acr0nym> Totally.
1292524723: <]3d0g> LOLed hard @ #4.
1292524761: <acr0nym> Yeah, those are some good ones.
1292527772: <tinfoil> So a few months ago, with no notice some director came out and said "As of today the CAM team is responsiple for all account creation and maintaince.  Everyone else will have their privledges removed."
1292527797: <tinfoil> They hired a bunch of helpdesk people to do AD account management
1292527810: <tinfoil> the thing is, they never ever once asked me how to manage linux accounts
1292527828: <tinfoil> We're *still* having fall out from this
1292527847: <dp> http://i.imgur.com/hRyy0.png
1292527847: <PipSqueek> http://i.imgur.com/hRyy0.png -- 
1292527885: <tinfoil> I've told the manager of the group and his assistant that managing unix accounts in AD is not standard administration *5* times now.  Ignored
1292527910: <tinfoil> Every time they reset someone's password, they lock them out - ticket comes to me
1292527925: <tinfoil> Every time they create a user, it never works, the ticket comes to me
1292527940: <tinfoil> Every time anything needs to be done with a linux user they break it worse
1292527949: <tinfoil> Fucking a
1292528000: <tinfoil> I just found out that after 3 months, none of them even have the Unix/NIS AD extensions installed in their management tools
1292528036: <tinfoil> I get a reply "You never told us we needed to do that"
1292528048: <acr0nym> So you forward the message where you told them?
1292528054: <tinfoil> "I told you that managing linux users were different than standard AD users, and you refused training."
1292528232: <tinfoil> Ultimatly it was the director who made the snap decision to make the migration over night
1292528235: <tinfoil> with no warning
1292528286: <tinfoil> and the average helpdesk monkey isn't expected to think outside the box, let alone do they have any experience to know anything about unix auth to AD
1292528621: <dp> I love being able to have people smarter than me working on my problem
1292528734: <fbx> wait...there are unix/NIS AD extensions? 
1292528737: <fbx> ;)
1292528971: <yyzchan> which ex girlfriend is this?  
1292529630: <dp> acr0nym: got configs for the circular calendar thing? I want to try it out
1292529699: <acr0nym> Allegedly, he fixed the SVN link on his page, so you ought to be able to get it now.
1292529789: <acr0nym> yeah, it works.
1292529815: <acr0nym> But, if you don't wanna go the svn route, I can get it to you.
1292529962: <dp> I've got the code
1292529976: <dp> I guess I just don't understand the config
1292530004: <acr0nym> Ah....
1292530028: <acr0nym> In what respect?
1292530314: <dp> well, the Hacker.cfg that's in the SVN; what are all the different values for?
1292530339: <dp> I get most of them, like PLACE, Lat*, Long*, TZOFFSET, Elevation, Holidays
1292530342: <dp> what about the rest?
1292530348: <acr0nym> Yeah, I didn't mess with any of the rest.
1292530349: <acr0nym> Heh.
1292530357: <acr0nym> So, I don't know.
1292530394: <dp> ok, what about the .rem files?
1292530404: <acr0nym> They're all reminder files.
1292530422: <acr0nym> They go into 'reminder' and spit out simple data.
1292530430: <acr0nym> Just read through them a bit, and you can figger 'em out.
1292530515: <dp> I don't get any holidays either
1292530543: <acr0nym> Do you get sed error messages?  Heh.
1292530567: <dp> no, but I am getting REMIND messages
1292530580: <acr0nym> Ohhhh....
1292530587: <acr0nym> The format changed, I think.....
1292530589: <acr0nym> Hold on.
1292530630: <dp> who wrote this thing anyway?
1292530641: <fbx> your mom
1292530644: <dp> ha
1292530646: <dp> how original
1292530674: <fbx> bah...c'mon...it's snowing, i've got to deal with the crazies on the road in 20 minutes and i'm bored
1292530677: <fbx> gimme a break
1292530764: <acr0nym> Heh, "Strawdog" wrote it.
1292530772: <acr0nym> And, he admits, it's flaky coding.
1292530851: <dp> whois Strawdog?
1292530873: <acr0nym> http://foulab.org/en/user/strawdog/Calendar
1292530873: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/8FJ9 (Circular Calendar foulab org)
1292530873: <acr0nym> Heh.
1292530873: <dp> bah
1292530885: <dp> he should github it, so I can fork and fix stuff
1292530892: <acr0nym> The format that "remind" takes changed since he wrote the script....
1292530928: <acr0nym> The commands in the "make_calendar.sh" script need to be changed.
1292531033: <acr0nym> Anyway that says "$YEAR-01-01" should be changed to "Jan $YEAR"
1292531039: <acr0nym> Anywhere, that is.
1292531351: <acr0nym> I do not comprehend how he gets the "moose hunting seaons" in the bottom calendar on that page, though.
1292531356: <acr0nym> But, also, I don't care a whole lot about it.
1292531775: <dp> ok, that did not seem to help
1292531804: <acr0nym> still got "remind" errors?
1292531807: <dp> yep
1292531816: <dp> I think I needed 1 Jan $YEAR
1292531840: <acr0nym> Hrmm.  That's not what I've got.
1292531869: <dp> nope, that didn't work either
1292531884: <dp> what version of remind do you have?
1292531897: <acr0nym> 03.01.05
1292531901: <dp> same
1292531902: <dp> hrm
1292531948: <acr0nym> Uh, check permissions on all the files.
1292531953: <acr0nym> Mebbe remind can't see the actual files.
1292531970: <acr0nym> It seems like the svn files left the permissions in a strange state.
1292531983: <dp> from what I can tell, everything is accessible
1292532028: <acr0nym> Hold on a sec.
1292532093: <acr0nym> Here, you can look at all of my files: http://www.acr0nym.com/CircularCalendar/trunk/
1292532093: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/8Fa7 (Index of CircularCalendar trunk)
1292532278: <dp> acr0nym: can you show me the values of some /tmp/make_calendar_(\d+).sunrise.rmd ?
1292532399: <dp> nm
1292532408: <dp> Jan $YEAR and "Jan $YEAR" are different
1292532776: <acr0nym> Heh, true.  But, in my statement, they were both quoted, so, you should have been able to figger it out.  ;)
1292532872: <dp> true
1292532894: <acr0nym> It's actually a pretty slick script.
1292534215: <dp> sweet! I found the problem with my script, and it has been fixed!
1292534346: <acr0nym> What was it?
1292534469: <dp> it pulls my checkins out of Foursquare, and adds them as Latitude entries
1292534479: <tinfoil> Nice
1292534483: <tinfoil> People use 4sq?
1292534485: <dp> heh
1292534489: <tinfoil> "Stalkers R us"
1292534502: <dp> only if you publish the data to everyone ;)
1292534522: <dp> and since the iPhone 3G doesn't allow background updating of Latitude, I have to use 4sq
1292534773: <dp> http://www.reddit.com/tb/emrzi
1292534773: <dp> ok, that's just fucking cool
1292534795: <acr0nym> Oh, THAT script.
1292534806: <tinfoil> Oh saw "black swan" last night
1292534813: <tinfoil> Great movie
1292534906: <tinfoil> dp:  that is pretty cool

1292535357: <dp> acr0nym: yes, that script
1292535365: <dp> the one I'd been bitching about for several days
1292535466: <]3d0g> I heard there's hot lezbo carpet munching in Black Swan.
1292535534: <tinfoil> That movie has some of the most hot "
1292535539: <tinfoil> sex" scenes I've seen
1292535557: <tinfoil> masturbation, seduction, carpet munching
1292535558: <tinfoil> etc
1292535569: <]3d0g> giggity
1292535604: <tinfoil> they are fairly small in the plot, but as a whole are critical to the story
1292535660: <]3d0g> Queen Amidala in 'em?
1292535732: <TeleCon> Sounds like.
1292535756: <acr0nym> Huh?  You're more concerned about Portman over Kunis?
1292535756: <]3d0g> 'bout time we got some proper Rule 34.

1292535919: <acr0nym> Hrmm.
1292535930: <acr0nym> Portman's already nekkid all over the intarwebs.
1292535933: <acr0nym> Not Mila.
1292535958: <]3d0g> naw, the existing portman stuff is not hawt.
1292535961: <tinfoil> Mila doesn't show off much more than you've seen
1292536250: <acr0nym> Bah.
1292536272: <]3d0g> Gotta show SUMTHIN' as it nearly got an X...
1292536283: <tinfoil> All Portman
1292536297: <]3d0g> giggity.
1292536854: <acr0nym> Heh.  Thanks Quagmire.
1292536922: <]3d0g> So you're occupying space at the Haus of Matt all next week?
1292536932: <acr0nym> Jah.
1292536950: <]3d0g> Coo. I'll figure out when to pop by on Monday.
1292536962: <acr0nym> Although, if you wanna be mucking with stuff this weekend, I might be able to arrange to swing by on the way to or from work to get stuff to you.
1292536972: <]3d0g> naw, not this week
1292536974: <]3d0g> -end
1292536981: <acr0nym> Okey dokey, I won't worry about it, then.
1292537310: <tinfoil> Oh yeah
1292537317: <tinfoil> You guys should check out a flick called "Ink"
1292537327: <tinfoil> it was filmed in Denver for $250k.
1292537350: <tinfoil> If you like Gaiman and McKean collaborated works, you'll probably like Ink
1292537379: <acr0nym> Gimme a torrent link, boy!  Sheesh.
1292537410: <dp> lol
1292537423: <tinfoil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBGeErufQdY
1292537423: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/8Fbh ( YouTube Ink Official Trailer 1 (HD) )
1292537423: <tinfoil> netflix it
1292537423: <tinfoil> sheesh
1292537432: <acr0nym> RIGHT.  I'm totally gonna get my first netflix account for one movie.
1292537475: <tinfoil> Ot
1292537494: <tinfoil> Find it on torrent yourself, I'm not installing torrent to find one movie for someone else.  :-)
1292537596: <tinfoil> If you don't find it, I'll look when I get home
1292537605: <acr0nym> Heh, I'll look later.
1292537657: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
1292537675: <tinfoil> Check out the youtube link
1292537688: <acr0nym> Oh, no, I did, it looks interesting.
1292537754: <tinfoil> The only negative aspect of the film is it needs your full attention because they don't explain everything up front, so you need to remember details from earlier in the flick to put it together

1292610726: <tinfoil> and waiting 4 minutes to realize "Wait, what am I doing that for?"
1292610748: <tinfoil> popped up tcpdump looked for arp requests
1292610752: <tinfoil> found the IP address
1292610778: <tinfoil> aliased by interface to the same network pinged it, got it's mac address, handed it to networking who disabled it
1292610782: <tinfoil> (the port)
1292610815: <tinfoil> meanwhile, everyone else was trying to get it to issue them an address via dhcp

1292862531: <tinfoil> bigger than a 747 with 15% lower operating costs
1292862612: <tinfoil> I wonder if any fly in/out of Seattle
1292862619: <tinfoil> will have to pay attention next time I'm there
1292862723: <tinfoil> It's funny to know that the 747 wouldn't sell until one of the pilots illegaly flew one through an air show while doing a barrel roll
1292862738: <nychan> that was the old tri-jet i thought
1292862760: <nychan> or maybe the 707
1292862766: <tinfoil> Maybe I am wrong
1292862776: <tinfoil> it was the largest passenger jet by far

1292864028: <tinfoil> TeleCon knows the psycho one
1292864039: <tinfoil> worked with her, infact
1292864070: <tinfoil> She is still harassing me, Tracy, and several other people I know
1292864089: <nychan> was she at least smoking hot?
1292864101: <tinfoil> She had a hot body and no teeth
1292864127: <nychan> wicked!
1292864142: <nychan> kinda like your mom but you didn't have to close your eyes
1292864201: <]3d0g> wow
1292864275: <nychan> .msg tinfoil dude can you please ask your mom to stop emailing me?
1292864528: <tinfoil> They had this game here to see how long you could go without hearing Little Drummer Boy
1292864534: <tinfoil> I lost last night, dammit
1292864543: <tinfoil> It starts on Thanks Giving and ends on Xmas
1292865436: <acr0nym> Dumbest.  Game.  Ever.
1292865461: <acr0nym> Because it involves two risks:  A)  Hearing Christmas music, and 2) paying attention to Christmas music.
1292865528: <]3d0g> BUT, it is time for the annual viewing of Bad Santa.
1292865601: <acr0nym> No kidding.
1292867074: <fbx> acr0nym: what's a "prime"?
1292867091: <acr0nym> Heh, it's a polyamory joke....
1292867132: <acr0nym> The "prime" relationship.  It was more a joke about calling tinfoil a swinger, regardless of what he actually is at this point.  ;)
1292867191: <fbx> polyamory...wow, there's a word i don't think i've ever used.
1292867203: <nychan> that's because you live in the real part of virginia
1292867215: <fbx> real backwards?
1292867219: <fbx> actually
1292867238: <nychan> linetrap is from richmond
1292867242: <fbx> they have "lasagna parties" here in western richmond in certain neighborhoods
1292867250: <fbx> bring your keys for the fishbowl
1292867269: <fbx> because you're not getting your own keys back
1292867275: <acr0nym> Why call it a lasagna party, as opposed to a key party?
1292867286: <nychan> i dont even know what a key party is so
1292867329: <fbx> acr0nym: good point. it's more obfuscatory?
1292867402: <fbx> nychan: key party = you bring your keys, put them in the fishbowl...later you pick a set, and whoever's keys you pick...well, that's your hookup for the night
1292867460: <fbx> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=key+party
1292867460: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/8G_X (Urban Dictionary key party)
1292867564: <nychan> urban dictionary = urban myth?  :D
1292867585: <nychan> <- poor rudolph.  no reindeer games
1292867608: <fbx> no, we actually know a couple who were invited to one. by mistake, sadly, as they're not swingers. quite the surprise for them.
1292867658: <nychan> just like rumors of port jervis being a major bdsm town
1292867664: <fbx> i may have to define lasagna party on urban dictionary, just for fun
1292867694: <]3d0g> and what's it?
1292867709: <nychan> lasagna parties here just means i don't eat for a few days prior
1292867716: <fbx> heh
1292867724: <nychan> cos we got... real ieyeltalians and stuff
1292867725: <fbx> or have sex for those days either?
1292867758: <nychan> i'd have the sex if i could.  works up an appetite
1292867766: <fbx> ]3d0g: what's a lasagna party or what's port jervis?
1292867972: <]3d0g> I'm afraid of either answer.
1292868311: <nychan> port jervis is a city where ny, nj, and pa meet
1292868321: <nychan> it's a little bit "deliverance" 
1292868348: <]3d0g> noted on the "must avoid" list.
1292868389: <nychan> it's got some of the best driving roads in the north east though
1292868426: <nychan> rt 97 is awesome.  though in the summer at night you have to be careful you don't run over a hacidic kid bolting across the road
1292868431: <nychan> from the river to the camp/cabins
1292868483: <nychan> rt 97@ snake hill is prolly one of the most filmed spots for car commercials
1292868485: <]3d0g> and they serve lasagna there?
1292868499: <nychan> yes but no meat
1292868505: <nychan> wouldn't be kosher
1292868973: <fbx> ]3d0g: lasagna party is apparently the west end richmond equivalent of a key party, which is a swinger's party replete with fishbowl, keys and sex with strangers.
1292869073: <]3d0g> See, the problem with that concept is, *someone's* bringing a fatty and guess who gets your keys?
1292869105: <fbx> nice
1292869135: <fbx> bah...have some faith...unless you're the fatty
1292869822: <nychan> in which case all results = good
1292869869: <nychan> kinda like no fault insurance states.  if you've got the best looking car, you've lost the most in any given transaction
1292872437: <acr0nym> fbx: Birthday?  Hrmph.  Well, happy birthday.
1292873195: <nychan> having a birthday this close to xmas must mean you get a lot of combo-ripoffs
1292876023: <fbx> acr0nym: thanks dude
1292876026: <fbx> nychan: indeed
1292876045: <fbx> "great...here's your birthday/july 4th gift. asshole."
1292876049: <fbx> never said, but...

1292950186: <TeleCon> I stayed up for it, and got a couple of OK pictures.
1292950210: <acr0nym> I should have tried for some pictures, I think.
1292950216: <acr0nym> It was awfully clear here.
1292950249: <TeleCon> I needed to use a better tripod, or a remote. A more powerful lense would have also been nice.
1292950400: <acr0nym> Heh, that's why I should have tried.
1292950402: <acr0nym> I have all those.
1292950413: <TeleCon> It was quite cold though.
1292950430: <TeleCon> What's the longest lense you have?
1292950440: <]3d0g> best lunar eclipse I've seen.
1292950451: <acr0nym> I don't remember.

1293035098: <]3d0g> what distro is that?
1293035108: <nychan> solaris 10
1293035135: <nychan> the only one i have handy has a blown PATH environment and i'm working through someone that's not an admin by trade
1293035176: <]3d0g> ooh, /me's solaris skills are very dusty. lemme hop on one...
1293035213: <]3d0g> /usr/bin/pkginfo
1293035218: <nychan> ahh thankee
1293035232: <nychan> that was surprisingly difficult to google.  every result assumes a worthing PATH
1293035279: <]3d0g> can see that
1293035379: <nychan> dp - sebastian your friend?
1293035440: <nychan> i always wondered why comcast didn't directly sponsor open source projects like open nms or hire a shit load of college students to work on it directly.  they prolly could structure it in such a way to be a tax write off
1293035443: <]3d0g> does he have Methuselah Syndrome?
1293035486: <nychan> 1 demerit for loosely referencing bladerunner
1293035497: <]3d0g> +1 for recognizing it.
1293035505: * nychan balls his fist and headbangs
1293035521: <]3d0g> We're in a bit of a shitstorm here over Open Source. 
1293035544: <nychan> any thing you're allowed to share?
1293035546: <]3d0g> Apparently some of the devs have integrated OS into products w/o considering the licensing ramifications. 
1293035553: <nychan> oh crap
1293035556: <]3d0g> yeah.
1293035599: <nychan> i was playing with some of the set top boxes comast is testing.  they're all linux now
1293035619: <nychan> if you sell hardware that's running the OS, do you have to make available the source code?
1293035627: <]3d0g> Well, *that's* not surprising as OCAP is an open standard.
1293035634: <]3d0g> yes
1293035639: <nychan> what about if you rent it
1293035657: <nychan> seems rent changes the equation a bit.  dunno.  not a gpl expert or a lawyer
1293035663: <]3d0g> me neither.
1293035685: <]3d0g> I watch them with moderate disinterest on TV, however.
1293035836: <nychan> i'm pissed i can't attach a USB hd to my dvr to expand it past the anemic 80gb internal
1293035857: <nychan> don't care if it's encrypted 20 ways to sunday so i can use it to rip movies.  i'd just like some more space
1293035888: <]3d0g> Dish Network allows it. You just gotta call 'em and there's a small "activation" fee.
1293035929: <nychan> hmm.  i'll try verizon but their customer service is awful for "weird" requests
1293036010: <nychan> what they ARE awesome at is packaging and pricing.  i called them up and said "i want all the channels, and 35 meg symmetric if you can make it cost less than 135 a month"
1293036047: <nychan> heard some key clicks, got asked if they could call me back.  10 minutes later i get a call back and "done"
1293036082: <nychan> they can finagle stuff that isn't available via web/self service
1293036097: <]3d0g> Eh, all of us are doing that as subs are still hemorrhaging due to foreclosures. You probably could've gotten a free BJ thrown in.
1293036128: <nychan> their call center was in georgia though
1293036134: <nychan> no way am i flying for head
1293036147: <]3d0g> you got something against black BJs?
1293036189: <nychan> SLIGHTLY yes.  you grab a black woman's weave and she'll bite your nuts off
1293036198: <nychan> otherwise no
1293036287: <nychan> atlanta is a shitty fucking airport too

1293467423: <nychan> does that mean superdrought for you in the summer, then?
1293467455: <]3d0g> No, the mountains (where all the water comes from) have been getting positively HAMMERED. 
1293467469: <]3d0g> upwards of 5' from the last storm.
1293467474: <nychan> holy crap
1293467521: <]3d0g> yeah, we took amtrak over the mountains to Glenwood Springs for the holiday. Left on thurs and ours was the 1st train to make it across in 3 days.
1293467523: <nychan> see shit like that makes me want to learn how to snowboard.  figure falling into that much powder isn't gonna hurt all that much

1293470099: <TeleCon> I'm surprised
1293470135: <TeleCon>  Mount Washington, the highest point in the U.S. east of the Mississippi River and north of the Carolinas, is located in northern New Hampshire about 1 1/2 hours northwest of Portland, 3 hours north of Boston, and about 3 1/2 hours southeast of Montr√©al. 
1293470264: <]3d0g> any updates on the move to the Land of Heat TC?
1293470394: <TeleCon> They said we wouldn't have an offer letter until January, but expressed intent.
1293470401: <TeleCon> Move will be Summerish.
1293470450: <]3d0g> so likely?
1293470457: <TeleCon> Very likely.
1293470482: <]3d0g> will you be accepting visitors during spring training season? :)

1293473607: <TeleCon> What format do you store on the camera?
1293473680: <tinfoil> We've been angry email and phone calls from someone in NYC all morning.  Ends up our asset theft tracking system was enabled on his laptop.  Did some investigation, it ends up it was an employee laptop motherboard that was put into his machine where he sent his laptop to be fixed.  The employee was terminated a few weeks ago and we locked his laptop.  He sold it to someone for parts, and they parted it out.
1293473692: <tinfoil> A) I use default ubuntu right now
1293473702: <TeleCon> for editing?
1293473722: <tinfoil> B) I store my images in raw - 14 bits records a lot more dynamic range than 8
1293473724: <tinfoil> yes
1293473732: <tinfoil> I'm 100% ubuntu
1293473743: <TeleCon> Yes, but which package? gimp?
1293473746: <tinfoil> 9.1 currently.  Upgrading to 10 soon
1293473750: <tinfoil> Oh
1293473753: <tinfoil> Bibble Pro
1293473792: <tinfoil> I do 90% of my editing in bibble (white balance, color correction, contrast, etc)
1293473802: <TeleCon> OK
1293473808: <tinfoil> http://bibblelabs.com/
1293473808: <PipSqueek> http://bibblelabs.com/ -- Bibble Labs Professional Photo Workflow Software
1293473809: <TeleCon> Yeah, found it already.
1293473844: <acr0nym> Yeah, that's the Lightroom equivalent for Linux....  Heh.
1293473848: <acr0nym> Couldn't remember.
1293473856: <tinfoil> It's cross platform
1293473867: <tinfoil> In some ways it's better than lightroom
1293473870: <tinfoil> in someways worse
1293473881: <tinfoil> I like it a lot - especially for asset management
1293473898: <tinfoil> It allows you multiple ways to store assets
1293473907: <tinfoil> err track
1293473940: <tinfoil> It's also very multi-threaded, so it's faster at performing some actions in bulk than its competition
1293473948: <tinfoil> like importing from RAW :-)
1293473970: <tinfoil> If I need to edit a 14bit or HDR image, I prefer CinePaint to make the edits
1293473976: <tinfoil> for things bibble can't do
1293473985: <tinfoil> Gimp still is the best for 8 bit images
1293474051: <tinfoil> So, we just caught our first employee laptop theft/reselling
1293474068: <tinfoil> by someone who ultimately purchased the laptop
1293474077: <TeleCon> Yeah. pretty cool.
1293474084: <TeleCon> Feel a bit sorry for the purchaser.
1293474085: <]3d0g> win
1293474088: <tinfoil> yeah
1293474098: <tinfoil> He's *PISSED*
1293474105: <tinfoil> and taking out on us
1293474110: <]3d0g> give him they employee's addy.
1293474116: <TeleCon> lol
1293474119: <tinfoil> Nah, we just called the cops on the employee
1293474130: <tinfoil> they should be picking them up shortly
1293474156: <tinfoil> ex-employee, I should say
1293474169: <tinfoil> either they produce the laptop or they get charged with theft
1293474174: <tinfoil> we can prove they sold the laptop
1293474180: <tinfoil> So, they get charged
1293474199: <tinfoil> Yeah, they showed us.
1293475361: <tinfoil> TeleCon: You all set to go?
1293475368: <tinfoil> photo wise?
1293475456: <acr0nym> Hah! http://xkcd.com/838/
1293475456: <PipSqueek> http://xkcd.com/838/ -- xkcd Incident
1293476197: <tinfoil> been thinking about getting a mac just so I can make video.
1293476210: <tinfoil> every linux NLE I use segfaults
1293476941: <TeleCon> I think so.
1293477147: <]3d0g> I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear Portman is knocked up.
1293477198: <acr0nym> Uh....
1293477215: <acr0nym> I think you're overreacting.
1293477265: <]3d0g> I find your lack of faith disturbing.
1293477831: <acr0nym> I'm sure.
1293478418: <tinfoil> You know, I used to have a crush on portman
1293478429: <tinfoil> then I found out she went Vegan and is close friends with Moby
1293481654: <acr0nym> Whatcha got against Moby?
1293481710: <tinfoil> 2002, he released the album after "play", which was notably not as good, in a major econimic collapse, and he goes out and make a press announcement that his sales are down because of pirating and software like napster
1293481729: <tinfoil> Showing his total detatchment from reality
1293481767: <tinfoil> He lost all respect from me at that point
1293481785: <acr0nym> Heh, fair enough.
1293481800: <acr0nym> Also:  "Spam Lite" is not NEARLY as interesting as the regular.
1293481902: <tinfoil> Spam gets a lot of shit, but if I were starving, I'd rather eat that than moby.  :-)
1293481929: <acr0nym> I like Spam just fine as long as it is cooked right.
1293481940: <acr0nym> Spam Lite, however, is a bunch less interesting.
1293482146: <tinfoil> True
1293482153: <tinfoil> as with anything "Lite"
1293482178: <tinfoil> Lets look at budweisser for example.  Uninteresting.  Bud Lite?  Even less interesting.
1293482369: <]3d0g> pfft. Moby can watch while I bend her over and fuck the vegan out of her.
1293483247: <TeleCon> lol

1293483459: <PipSqueek> http://vimeo.com/18213768 -- 
1293484815: <TeleCon> That's pretty cool.
1293484823: <TeleCon> How do you do an every 5 seconds like that?
1293484838: <acr0nym> 5 minutes.
1293484845: <acr0nym> And, like he said, remote timer.  Heh.
1293484868: <TeleCon> Well, yeah, 5 minutes.
1293484901: <tinfoil> Intervolometer (sp?)  ...  http://sbr.cx/e4bzd2 (an example)

1293484901: <acr0nym> My camera won't do it, but I didn't find software that connects via USB that can.
1293484906: <tinfoil> gphoto2 works
1293484909: <tinfoil> for linux
1293484914: <acr0nym> I can't remember what the software is called that I used.  Heh.
1293484920: <tinfoil> I'd rather not have to bring a laptop with me  :-)
1293484973: <acr0nym> Yeah, I wish my camera had that kind of functionality built in.
1293484990: <TeleCon> Those don't seem to support my camera.
1293485008: <tinfoil> TeleCon: That was for my camera
1293485011: <tinfoil> what kind of camera do you use?
1293485012: <TeleCon> :)
1293485030: <TeleCon> d3000
1293485035: <TeleCon> I'm finding some, I think.
1293485044: <]3d0g> gawker for Mac works well for time lapse
1293485048: <tinfoil> It's the same deal, different connector
1293485053: <tinfoil> Who uses mac, though?
1293485058: * tinfoil ducks
1293485061: <]3d0g> fucking hipsters.
1293485078: <acr0nym> Hey, any luck with the ISP programmer, ]3d0g 
1293485079: <acr0nym> ?
1293485089: <TeleCon> gphoto2 might work for me.
1293485093: <TeleCon> Need to play some.
1293485094: <]3d0g> been out of town. 
1293485099: <acr0nym> Ah, groovy.
1293485157: <tinfoil> If you're using ubuntu you need to unmount your camera before you can use gphoto2 
1293485174: <tinfoil> unbuntu uses the gphoto2 api to auto-mount your camera when you plug it in
1293485185: <TeleCon> OK
1293485203: <tinfoil> (ie - conflict)
1293485207: <TeleCon> Yeah
1293485222: <TeleCon> Like I said, need to play some.
1293485224: <TeleCon> :)

1293485952: <tinfoil> Ok, the GoProCamera.com website has a very cool video on the front page.
1293486033: <TeleCon> I just got a touch of vertigo from that.
1293486046: <tinfoil> yeah
1293486049: <tinfoil> awesome, eh?
1293486056: <TeleCon> Very much so.
1293486190: <tinfoil> What made you want to take photos?
1293486203: <TeleCon> Dude.
1293486205: <TeleCon> Twins.
1293486210: <tinfoil> That'll do it
1293486221: <TeleCon> You've seen what I already have online, haven't you?
1293486225: <tinfoil> No
1293486228: <TeleCon> I think I have 12K photos in picasa.
1293486233: <TeleCon> Ish
1293486235: <tinfoil> URL me
1293486238: <]3d0g> oh, *your* twins. You had me excited there for a moment.
1293486243: <TeleCon> lol
1293486258: <TeleCon> Better not olsen up my twins.

1293486562: <tinfoil> Heh, I have about 2000 in picasa, most are private.  :-)
1293486572: <tinfoil> Pretty much use picasa to give images to clients
1293486579: <]3d0g> Was just looking at the 960. $180 for a fully weather-proof HD helmet cam is pretty awesome.
1293486592: <TeleCon> tinfoil: I use picasa for remote backup.
1293486594: <]3d0g> bookmarked.
1293486697: <tinfoil> Not finding you
1293486706: <TeleCon> hm

1293486784: <TeleCon> I need to do some cleanup though.
1293486980: <tinfoil> Cool :-)
1293487186: <TeleCon> I do have a lot of duplicate albums.
1293487258: <tinfoil> I need to start taking more photos
1293487271: <tinfoil> Take so many private photos that I can't show them
1293487287: <TeleCon> :)
1293487302: <TeleCon> I wonder if I had a remote in the box for the d3000
1293487347: <TeleCon> doesn't look like it.
1293487464: <acr0nym> I'd have been surprised.
1293487599: <tinfoil> It's unlikely
1293487659: <TeleCon> It's inexpensive though.
1293487680: <tinfoil> I love my remotes
1293487683: <tinfoil> Both of them
1293487695: <TeleCon> ir only though.
1293487715: <tinfoil> IR and cable are useful for different reasons

1293487730: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/8INI (Time Lapse Photography System for Nikon Cameras)
1293487730: <TeleCon> I don't know about a cable option on mine.
1293487781: <acr0nym> Cool.
1293487792: <tinfoil> Heh I'm looking that up and failing.  Wow, I guess you can't do cable release
1293487798: <TeleCon> Nope
1293487804: <tinfoil> Lame
1293487804: <TeleCon> Or, not that I've found yet.
1293487844: <acr0nym> Doesn't seem to.
1293488373: <TeleCon> I'll need one for the next eclips, I think
1293488422: <tinfoil> You don't
1293488437: <tinfoil> set up a 2 second delay and a feature usually called "mirror lockup"
1293488446: <tinfoil> even my cheap T1i has the feature
1293488466: <acr0nym> Mine won't do it.
1293488470: <acr0nym> I've looked.
1293488476: <tinfoil> delay?
1293488484: <acr0nym> No, mirror lock-up.
1293488488: <tinfoil> oh
1293488496: <tinfoil> If you expose more than 1-2 seconds it's not a big deal
1293488509: <tinfoil> but it helps make long exposure shots sharper
1293488513: <acr0nym> Yeah.  Also, the remote can be had for less than 20 bucks.
1293488515: <TeleCon> Yeah, I should have done the 2 second delay. That would have worked.
1293488546: <TeleCon> 54 bucks for that kit looking intervalometer.
1293488555: <acr0nym> The remote is how I shoot fireworks: http://www.acr0nym.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_itemId=3578

1293488555: <TeleCon> s/bucks/euros
1293488575: <acr0nym> Also, I did some cool stuff over the weekend, shooting christmas lights, in conjunction with the moon, that I'll work on posting.
1293488578: <acr0nym> Heh
1293488619: <tinfoil> Cool :-)
1293488632: <tinfoil> I haven't seen the moon in months
1293489057: <TeleCon> Crap
1293489069: <TeleCon> I was hoping the nerdkit would be cheaper than the 50 euro one.
1293489072: <TeleCon> But it is not.
1293489109: <TeleCon> Of course there is the whole buildit myself aspect.
1293489110: <TeleCon> Hmmmm.
1293489496: <TeleCon> ok
1293489507: <TeleCon> See you guys latah!
1293489513: <tinfoil> night :-)
1293489567: <acr0nym> Yeah, I believe this is about where I've gotta say "screw it" as well.
1293489568: <acr0nym> Heh.
1293490537: <tinfoil> Just ordered my own intervalometer

1293630266: <fbx> i have a question, channel
1293630272: <dp> I have an answer
1293630292: <fbx> how do you write the plural of UPS?
1293630312: <dp> as in the battery system?
1293630324: <fbx> yep
1293630330: <dp> I'd write it as UPSs
1293630337: <fbx> interesting
1293630344: <fbx> i usually use UPSes
1293630352: <fbx> i've also seen UPS's
1293630363: <fbx> ...which I can't believe is correct...
1293630413: <acr0nym> actualy, it is....
1293630421: <fbx> really?
1293630432: <acr0nym> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym_and_initialism#Representing_plurals_and_possessives
1293630432: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/8ItD (Acronym and initialism Wikipedia the free encyclopedia)
1293630432: <fbx> huh
1293630524: <dp> so which is correct?
1293630532: <acr0nym> UPS's.
1293630543: <dp> However, it has become common among many writers to inflect initialisms as ordinary words, using simple s, without an apostrophe, for the plural. In this case, compact discs becomes CDs. The logic here is that the apostrophe should be restricted to possessives: for example, the CD‚Äôs label (the label of the compact disc).
1293630551: <fbx> count on a grammar question to awaken acr0nym 
1293630566: <acr0nym> however, an apostrophe may increase clarity: for example, if the final letter of an abbreviation is S, as in SOSís, or when pluralizing an abbreviation that has periods.
1293630573: <fbx> but i'm using a multiple, not a possessive
1293630582: <fbx> nm
1293630595: <dp> may. so potentially, either is correct
1293630610: <acr0nym> More importantly, ask an acronym question, how likely is that to get my attention?  Heh.
1293630614: <fbx> either way, i think i'll have to stop using UPSes
1293630694: <acr0nym> Yeah, there's not actually a GOOD answer, per se.
1293630772: <fbx> no, i got what i wanted: "not what you're using"
1293630778: <fbx> ;)

1293635870: <nychan> which was pretty neat until i realized i didn't want to fuck around with managing my own mail at all anymore
1293635902: <dp> I don't either

1293635920: <dp> they don't want to pay for it

1294162299: <tinfoil> Also, I was told by a manager that 100% of our customer routed network is centrally authenticated
1294162320: <tinfoil> I ask him for a list of all assets, he can't provide it
1294162333: <tinfoil> so I ask him how he knows everything is centrally authenticated
1294162340: <tinfoil> "because it's procedure"
1294162366: <tinfoil> So, let me get this right - you don't even know everything that's out there, yet you *know* 100% of it is configured properly

1294163575: <dp> acr0nym: H.E. is a fricking literary genius
1294163589: <tinfoil> and a nutjob
1294163594: <dp> agreed
1294163597: <tinfoil> I've met him, several times.  :-)
1294163600: <dp> but still an amazing writer
1294163604: <tinfoil> Agreed
1294164367: <tinfoil> Ok, the concept of "The Road" is similar to "A boy and his dog", but that's about it.  The tone and relationship between the characters is totally different, and there is no advanced society living under ground
1294164384: <tinfoil> yeah, he's getting more wacky in his age
1294164402: <acr0nym>  I have "Dreams with Sharp Teeth", if you wanna see it....

1294164445: <tinfoil> oh, I see
1294164501: <acr0nym> I'm told it's pretty much 90 minutes of being a good example of why you don't wanna hang out with Harlan Ellison.
1294164528: <acr0nym> Haven't watched it yet.
1294164813: <tinfoil> That made me think of this novel I read last year called "Sharp Teeth"  Was pretty good:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Teeth

1294164850: <tinfoil> The plot synopsis doesn't do it justice
1294164880: <tinfoil> Everyone I know who read it was quickly sucked in.
1294164972: <acr0nym> I'm not reading it unless I can pirate it.  :)

1294164984: <acr0nym> Heh.
1294166624: <tinfoil> No it's not, but it's quality reading
1294166662: <tinfoil> I picked it up to read the first page, next thing I knew I was 100 pages in.
1294166676: <tinfoil> Same thing happened to 3 others I know who read it
1294169450: <acr0nym> Do you think food that has a "best-by" date in November of 2009 is safe?

1294866814: <dp> sparkfun?
1294866847: <]3d0g> yup

1294868017: <acr0nym> Heh.
1294868088: <acr0nym> Ah, actually, the way they're going about it is pretty smart.
1294868105: <]3d0g> yeah, better than last year.
1294868176: <acr0nym> Strictly speaking, I still don't know enough about electronics to take any of the quizzes, or, at least, many of them, nor is it worth me being someone who gets free stuff from them.
1294868188: <acr0nym> However, I DID download a whole shitton of PDF's yesterday, that should help.  :)
1294868205: <acr0nym> Oh, as a side note, anyone who wants some Electronics PDF's, lemme know.  Heh.
1294868333: <]3d0g> I'll bet they're ridiculously easy, like which one is the SOIC, etc.
1294868344: <acr0nym> Yeah, see, I dunno the answer to that.  Heh.
1294868377: <]3d0g> yet you've been soldering them 
1294868380: <acr0nym> I expect that the "Make: Electronics" book will treat me pretty well, though.
1294868392: <acr0nym> Sure, from simple, simple instructions, with pictures, and stuff.
1294868395: <acr0nym> What's an SOIC?
1294868406: <]3d0g> Small Outline Integrated Circuit
1294868416: <acr0nym> Uh....
1294868417: <acr0nym> Okay.
1294868434: <acr0nym> Ah, gotcha.

1295545948: <TeleCon> oi
1295548242: <dp> if I hook up my iphone's headphone jack to my PCs microphone jack, will I be able to "hear" what's happening?
1295550619: <tinfoil> Wow, 78K devices discovered
1295550647: <tinfoil> I did it in about 4 hours with thcrut.  Even for not being updated since 2003 it's a useful tool if used right
1295550670: <tinfoil> 78k devices among 17M addresses
1295553372: <dp> thcrut?
1295553376: <dp> never even heard of that
1295555250: <acr0nym> tinfoil loves the tools nobody's heard of.  Next, it'll be "klaatu".
1295555287: <acr0nym> Or, nikto, whichever the hell it was.
1295556346: <tinfoil> If you haven't heard of nikto and work in security assessments and pentesting, you should be fired
1295556349: <tinfoil> It's still actively used
1295556377: <tinfoil> thcrut is notably obscure, mostly a proof of concept
1295556394: <tinfoil> nmap is more robust, but isn't nearly as fast
1295556478: <tinfoil> thcrut more of less offloads the heavy lifting of discovery to your upstream router.
1295556491: <tinfoil> Then watches for return packets
1295556545: <tinfoil> The problem is, if it discovers a network range that is a routing loop it can take out an ISP grade router in seconds flat
1295556642: <tinfoil> due to how it works though, it's intelligent enough to discover hosts that exist but are totally firewalled - at least in some configurations
1295556827: <tinfoil> I wrote up the workflow for my own discovery tool based on thcrut and nmap ideas back in like 2004, but not nearly skilled enough to develop it.  Amazingly enough most of those concepts still haven't been used yet.
1295557218: <TeleCon> I am so going to need a drink by the end of the day.
1295557230: <acr0nym> Me, too.
1295559449: <dp> hrm.
1295559452: <dp> as I just told a friend
1295559470: <dp> you know, 14.7ms doesn't sound like a long time
1295559480: <dp> but when the task that takes 14.7ms runs 16k times, it suddenly becomes almost 5minutes
1295559587: <tinfoil> yah
1295559594: <tinfoil> that's a great way to put it
1295559626: <dp> I'm trying to improve the performance of a script I'm writing. but there's just so much data
1295559653: <tinfoil> What's it do?
1295559669: <dp> provide stats for our clients
1295559703: <dp> pulls data out of an analytics program, sums them, puts a lot of other data together, stuffs them in an excel file, and emails it
1295561149: <tinfoil> Oh yeah, that is a lot of data.
1295565692: <tinfoil> Neat because of the techniques I used, I found a bunch of machines with open ssh ports but don't respond to ping.
1295565712: <tinfoil> Not often that happens on an internal network :-)
1295571430: <PDXchan> acr0nym: the uzi pen does NOT make for a proper substitute nose hair trimmer
1295574364: <tinfoil> Did you end up with a blue nose?

1295893084: <PipSqueek> http://goo.gl/Kowj9 (dp s blog Blog Archive Looking to dig deeper in programming)
1295893903: <tinfoil> Interesting
1295893906: <tinfoil> No idea :-)
1295893909: <tinfoil> I find things as needed
1295894045: <tinfoil> As for Markov, look up crm114 and read the papers - They no longer use markov in favor of OMB pairs - less data, faster, and more accurate
1295894065: <tinfoil> I love their algorethems, just hate the interface
1295894075: <tinfoil> regardless, they are a great source of intellectual knowledge
1295894180: <dp> I looked at crm114. I don't have the math skills to follow along :(
1295894216: <tinfoil> Did you pass basic trig in school?
1295894228: <dp> yeah, but that was 15 years ago
1295894229: <tinfoil> If so, their math isn't much harder
1295894231: <dp> and
1295894235: <dp> I hated trig
1295894258: <tinfoil> Oh, I didn't get past Alg2 in school... taught myself trig because it was fun (and very useful)
1295894271: * tinfoil is a masochist
1295894275: <tinfoil> anyway
1295894289: <dp> I got past alg2. I took Calc in HS, even though I failed it miserably
1295894310: <tinfoil> I hate calc - don't see a use for it unless you're doing complex engineering or physics
1295894359: <tinfoil> Blame newton for that crud
1295894363: <tinfoil> :-)
1295894394: <tinfoil> Seriously, don't look at the math of CRM114 so much as the algorthim bits.  You can get by with basic math if you get past the pretentious stuff
1295894465: <tinfoil> Well, that being said, the distance algorthem that CRM114 used for "hyperspace" is brilliantly simple
1295894481: <tinfoil> Even if they proved it's not the most accurate algorthim
1295894487: <tinfoil> It's useful
1295894694: <tinfoil> CRM114 used it to define set categories.
1295894703: <tinfoil> I was using it to find similar articles
1295894709: <tinfoil> based on RSS feeds
1295894899: <tinfoil> Oh, the distance algorthem implemented the inverse square law making the distance hyperbolic.  
1295894920: <tinfoil> (brilliant for uncategorized documents)
1295894929: * dp begins translation attempt
1295894947: <tinfoil> Dude, for some of the shit you've shown me, you CAN do this.  :-)
1295894957: <tinfoil> Just remember, it's the learning curve
1295894982: <tinfoil> Look at some of the SQL queries you do now - look back 10 years and imagine how you'd feel about them
1295895072: <tinfoil> If I had 1/2 your skills I'd be a developer
1295898454: <tinfoil> Oh, installed KDEnlive on my workstation after I reinstalled it

Near the end of filming, Cattrall had a photographer shoot a roll of film on the Enterprise bridge set, in which she wore nothing but her Vulcan ears. After finding out about the unauthorized photo session, Leonard Nimoy had the film destroyed"
1295909534: <acr0nym> Heh.  No doubt.
1295910868: <tinfoil> damn... visa requires $750 deposite if you intend on being a merchant selling soft goods (no physical product)

1296240500: <tinfoil> since one manager claimed 100% of the devices are authenticated with LDAP or RADIUS
1296240506: <tinfoil> how many do you think actually are?

1296240690: <tinfoil> About 0.7%

1296241923: <tinfoil> Love it
1296242076: <tinfoil> Want to see the current script?
1296242182: <tinfoil> I sent it anyway :-)
1296242271: <tinfoil> Hah I just found a bug

1296242318: <dp> k
1296242324: <tinfoil> thanks for making me look at the script
1296242418: <dp> ha
1296242430: <tinfoil> It's a minor error, but it's an error
1296242720: <dp> set password "PASSWORD\r"
1296242724: <dp> that prompts for the password?
1296242798: <tinfoil> no, that sets the variable password to whatever is in the string
1296242821: <dp> ah
1296242847: <dp> so that script will ssh to the single host you specify, and print the responses that you've set
1296242871: <dp> I need to do some expect scripting. I think it'll be hella useful for me
1296242875: <tinfoil> to STDERR
1296242889: <dp> right
1296242891: <tinfoil> The handy bit was learning the while loop
1296242908: <dp> lrange; that's just the range of IPs you set?
1296242932: <tinfoil> $argv is an array
1296242941: <tinfoil> I'm saying pull a single item from the array
1296242959: <tinfoil> I could make it more complex, but I like my test scripts to only handle one test at a time
1296242965: <tinfoil> per host
1296242998: <tinfoil> it could be improved
1296242999: <tinfoil> but it works
1296243264: <tinfoil> sent you the updated version - basically properly handled SSH timeout and changed some verbage around
1296243322: <tinfoil> Verbage change was because a co-worker didn't clearly understand it.  
1296243707: <dp> and how do you run said script? what's the commandline?
1296244021: <tinfoil> expect script_name ip.add.ress
1296244584: <tinfoil> Think I'm going to add expect scripting to my next line of interview questions
1296244606: <tinfoil> It won't count against, but will be nice bonus material
1296245870: <TeleCon> How do you expect that to work out?
1296246157: <tinfoil> How do you mean?
1296246240: <TeleCon> It was a punthorical question. It may safely be ignored.
1296246259: <tinfoil> Thought so, but it was seriously enough asked I had to be sure

1296507512: <tinfoil> I admit, DP helped with the only minor problem I had :-)
1296507590: <tinfoil> Of course, the auditors asked the wrong question, so the data I provided will cause a whole slew of meetings
1296507598: <tinfoil> I made note of that when I provided my report
1296507677: <tinfoil> I'll let them figure that part out while I collect the data they are going to ask for when they come to the same conclusion.  :-)

1296593912: <tinfoil> if I do them on my own, I'd do things at a much faster pace, but then management would always expect that from me :-)
1296593941: <tinfoil> There is some joking there
1296593962: <tinfoil> Management is being pretty strict about enforcing what we access and when
1296593980: <tinfoil> but there are times I get hit up to bypass the system in the name of effency

1297182457: <dp> so, crucial.com shows my order from the 24th of January on one page
1297182471: <dp> if I try to get an RMA number for it though, it shows I have no orders in the last 90 days
1297183718: <acr0nym> Nice!
1297191677: <milkchan> americablog, commondreams.org, daily kos, mother jones, raw story, talking points memo, think progress, washington monthly, and wonkette
1297191696: <acr0nym> THERE'S a slow response.
1297191702: <dp> milkchan: which of those are right wing?
1297191708: <milkchan> none
1297191711: <TeleCon> none
1297191712: <dp> I've already got talking points
1297191714: <TeleCon> What he said.
1297191715: <dp> ah
1297191734: <milkchan> right wing blogs actually knocked me left-er than where i thought i was
1297191746: <dp> I'm trying to make sure I get both sides of the story
1297191756: <dp> milkchan: you use reader?
1297191764: <dp> gReader that is
1297191777: <milkchan> the comments on right wing blogs just made me want to vomit and emmigrate somewhere freer like cambodia
1297191782: <milkchan> google reader?
1297191783: <milkchan> yes
1297191794: <dp> meh; not interested in the comments ;)
1297191811: <milkchan> the comments on left wing blogs are well worth the reading
1297191816: <milkchan> which is why my outlook really changed
1297191836: <milkchan> blogs are the mouthpiece, the comments show the relative value of the community
1297191846: <milkchan> right wing blog comments come in the following forms
1297191848: <milkchan> 1.  ditto
1297191856: <milkchan> that's literal
1297191860: <milkchan> not a description
1297191866: <milkchan> 2. bible passages
1297191887: <milkchan> 3. tl;dnr - fucking 40 page incoherant rant passing itself off as erudition
1297191905: <milkchan> 4. flecked spittle outrage bordering on actual death threat
1297191928: <milkchan> left wing blogs have quite literate and spirited discussions and disagrements
1297191959: <milkchan> which are actually much better at giving you both sides of the story than reading what's essentially propaganda for illiterate brownshirts
1297192026: <milkchan> this country is fucked because a fiscal conservative that doesn't care where you stick your dick or how you dispose of your fetus or what imaginary best friend you worship.... has no party of their own
1297192075: <milkchan> by fiscal conservative, i mean rational legislation that curbs the natural excesses of what are essentially parasitic entities known as corporations.
1297192103: <milkchan> think tea partier with a reverse lobotomy
1297192221: <TeleCon> milkchan: That describes much what I think as  member of the LP.
1297192232: <milkchan> the lp?
1297192247: <dp> libertarian party
1297192253: <dp> which, I'd agree with
1297192297: <milkchan> libertarians suffer from doctrinal purity problems.  it's good to have an ideology, it's also good to recognize it doesn't always work the way your theories describe
1297192339: <]3d0g> Enron and the like were a brutal reality check for the LP.
1297192344: <milkchan> markets CAN'T self-regulate
1297192357: <milkchan> think lord of the flies where kids = corps
1297192437: <milkchan> plus there's way more than two sides to every story.  i'm only a leftist because the entire country swung so far right that it would make nixon and reagan look like flaming political queers today
1297192465: <milkchan> there's regulation that hurts, there's regulation that helps.  there's deregulation that hurts, there's deregulation that helps
1297192495: <milkchan> (de)regulation in isolation doesn't describe what it's trying to actually solve
1297192597: <milkchan> there needs to be a republican resurgence in the vein of teddy.  the govt SHOULD be able to smack the shit out of the corps when they step out of line
1297192625: <milkchan> and the dems need to fucking find their inner FDR
1297192651: <milkchan> cos right now they're both so compromised and fucking moronic, that they're failing to address actual problems
1297192707: * milkchan steps off soapbox
1297192839: <]3d0g> I'll challenge all that. The politicians are merely a mirror of the people. 
1297192846: <]3d0g> THAT'S where the problem is.
1297192868: <]3d0g> They want the government to give them jobs, but NOT raise taxes.
1297192892: <]3d0g> They want their underwater mortgages reduced, but FUCK those damn bankers.
1297192907: <milkchan> er the bankers aren't getting fucked at all last i checked ^^
1297192927: <]3d0g> They want social security and medicare FOREVER, but HELL NO to "socialized" medicine. 
1297192931: <milkchan> until that last line, i would have conceded to your point entirely
1297192945: <]3d0g> you're misreading
1297192959: <]3d0g> people are still pissed about the bank bailout.
1297193011: <milkchan> yes but until we can reverse citizens united, the govt is more a mirror of big money than the people.  the politicians are mouthing our way and voting another
1297193016: <]3d0g> (continuing...) They want Immigration control, but they want nothing to do with actually picking veggies in CA or cooking burritos in Taco Bell, or, god forbid, mowing lawns.
1297193037: <milkchan> i'm pissed as hell about the bailouts.  when i gamble and win, i pay taxes.  when i gamble and lose, i eat it
1297193070: <milkchan> ah so the attitude that we want everything but don't want to be responsible for everything mirror
1297193111: <]3d0g> The Joker had it right all along. "This town (country) needs an enema!"
1297193246: <]3d0g> To be brutally honest, this country's gonna be fucked until the baby boomers fucking die.

1297709041: <tinfoil> So there is a turn-of-the-century warehouse building near my apartment that is filled with artists now.
1297709061: <acr0nym> Better get a bunch of lime, or they're gonna start to stink.
1297709070: <tinfoil> The building suffered massive damage in 2001 due to the earthquake
1297709077: <tinfoil> it wasn't condemed
1297709107: <tinfoil> It came up unstable during a review by the city recently
1297709117: <tinfoil> and the artists are outraged that the city wants to knock it down

1297709245: <tinfoil> I love how the artists are vilifying the government
1297709418: <fbx> good god...don't park near that thing either
1297709439: <fbx> it's due to go down any moment, i'd wager
1297709661: <tinfoil> Yeah, so they'd rather fight the city about it

1297810222: <]3d0g> what's the corp vpn - just curious?
1297811442: <tinfoil> Cisco with a SecurID SoftToken
1297811550: <tinfoil> We're migrating to DirectAccess for non-administrative users, however.
1297811720: <]3d0g> Cisco supports linux pretty well
1297811737: <]3d0g> one of the major reasons why we went with it over juniper.
1297811750: <tinfoil> They didn't support ubuntu when we tried last year
1297811780: <tinfoil> How well does the SecurID softtoken work?
1297811791: <]3d0g> yeah, it works great with the cisco NetworkManager plug-in.
1297811797: <tinfoil> We went that route over hard tokens
1297811807: <]3d0g> works fine. just have to enter the token @ login
1297811818: <]3d0g> yeah, we're giving up on fobs too
1297811833: <]3d0g> fuckin' RSA thinks they're made of gold.
1297811850: <tinfoil> We'll try again, I suppose
1297811852: <]3d0g> gotta run

1297874688: <PipSqueek> http://goo.gl/Bw7Xh (Google)
1297876400: <fbx> nice
1297876436: <fbx> what gives you chills? the voice? the fact he can ring in faster than anyone else because - hey look! - no thumbs?
1297876454: <fbx> or the actual fuzzy logic IBM has been working on for about 4 years now?
1297876470: <]3d0g> yeah, you're like most - don't know what's really going on.
1297876475: <]3d0g> he *does* have a thumb.
1297876507: <]3d0g> he's also doing real-time language processing with scary accuracy. 
1297876530: <fbx> i got that part, which i have to admit is both fascinating and sobering
1297876544: <fbx> i did miss the part about the thumbs though
1297876545: <]3d0g> he also understands puns, wordplay, and abstract associations.
1297876564: <]3d0g> and he's NOT connected to the Internet, as most assume.
1297876565: <fbx> "run for president" vs "run a marathon"
1297876588: <fbx> contextual processing is good stuff
1297876664: <]3d0g> Unexpectedly, the MIL has enormous interest in it too.
1297876688: <fbx> i would imagine darpa helped fund this, to be honest
1297876776: <]3d0g> think what this kind of contextual calculator could do turned on the stock market...
1297876828: <fbx> the market is so far beyond humans making money through strict technical analysis at this point...
1297876857: <]3d0g> hardly.
1297876880: <]3d0g> humans just can put together all the triggers fast enough.
1297876949: <fbx> ok, i'll restate: the amount of programmatic trading that makes fractions of pennies which add up to billions is entirely computer based
1297877020: <fbx> i'd wager it's far more than human technical analysis makes in several years
1297877044: <fbx> who needs context to make more? ;)
1297877065: <]3d0g> leveraging the inherent speed limitations of the system, yes yes. now what if a "watson" could deduce that a car crash in Dubai would lead to unrest that would lead to a spike in oil futures> 
1297877066: <]3d0g> ?
1297877104: <fbx> i'd rather have watson doing weather analysis, but yeah, i get your point
1297877116: <acr0nym> Minority Report!  Yaaay.
1297877151: <fbx> then again, that type of analysis is relying on human behavior in the marketplace, which is far, far from "rational"
1297877153: <]3d0g> IBM made an interesting point in last night's ep. They said the vast majority of information in the world is still in "human" format, not computer. 
1297877170: <fbx> i heard you say "Turing Test"
1297877176: <fbx> is that what you said?
1297877178: <fbx> ;)
1297877217: <fbx> wait

1297877350: <]3d0g> Mehtinks were rushing towards the Singularity awful quick, but maybe I've just watched Terminator too many times.
1297877380: <fbx> i could see a blade runner future more than a terminator future, myself
1297877387: <fbx> not that that's any more comforting
1297877414: <]3d0g> meh, we're a hell of a lot closer to AI than a mech-bio interface.
1297877439: <]3d0g> otherwise I'd already have a USB port in my noggin.

1297970639: <tinfoil> Building a dedicated firewall for my desk right now...
1297970726: <acr0nym> I've considered that, just because it's a campus.

1297983494: <]3d0g> fire up the player, click on the album tab, long-press on your album and add to playlist.
1297983510: <tinfoil> All 15 copies?
1297983545: <tinfoil> Under the album tab, is lists a seperate album for each artist on the album

1297983582: <tinfoil> It did this for a remix album I have, but not another one
1297983590: <]3d0g> well, worst case, yeah. add each song to the playlist.

1297984086: <tinfoil> the ones that don't work properly have a seperate folder for each artist

1298057446: <dp> gotta have backup payment
1298057450: <tinfoil> So I sent them a very condescending message saying - "I selected paypal so I wouldn't need to give you my credit card information.  I assume since you have paypal as an option on the order form that you accept payment from paypal.  When you give me information how to pay via paypal, I'll give you my payment.  It's quite simple, really."
1298057478: <tinfoil> I'm planning on paying a year in advance.

1298399316: <tinfoil> ]3d0g: Oi, two things.  The MP3 android multiple album issue was due to seperate folders for MP3's with the same album name.
1298399327: <tinfoil> ]3d0g: The other thing - Know much about stepper motors?
1298399388: <]3d0g> so android does do something with folders? interesting.
1298399419: <tinfoil> It makes sense, if two artists come out with the same album name.
1298399442: <tinfoil> Where as multiple artists per album are often sorted by the album artist not the track artist
1298399447: <]3d0g> I dabbled with pwm and stepper motors a bit
1298399543: <tinfoil> I'm looking to create a timelapse-dolly system.  The catch is since I've been mixing in longer exposures, using a slow constantly running motor (which is popular) would induce too much of the wrong blur.
1298399582: <tinfoil> I figured a stepper motor might work.  It's something totally new to me, though
1298399597: <tinfoil> Take photo, step, take photo, step
1298399666: <]3d0g> hmm like stepping in a circle?
1298399693: <tinfoil> Define "circle"?  Not sure what you mean.
1298399735: <]3d0g> I'm unclear how stepping will change the photo. 
1298399786: <tinfoil> I've been mixing long-exposure and time-lapse photography... For example taking a 1/2sec photo every 2 seconds, and then stitching it together into a video
1298399814: <tinfoil> Most homebrew timelapse dollies that I've seen use a slow constantly running motor
1298399825: <tinfoil> but with a longer exposure the motion of that motor would incur a blur
1298399826: <]3d0g> like for astrophotography. 
1298399837: <tinfoil> That's a great example, yes
1298399930: <tinfoil> Understanding stepper motors is totally different than other electric motors... No idea how they are rated, how big of one I need, etc
1298400076: <tinfoil> The stepper would, I assume, give an easy to control precise movement
1298400195: <tinfoil> Oh, I'm totally overengineering this
1298400717: <tinfoil> They make wheeled robot platforms with stepper motors
1298400720: <tinfoil> problem solved :-)
1298400755: <]3d0g> I was thinking an astro mount would still work. most are USB controllable.
1298400861: <tinfoil> They make dolly's for that?
1298400886: <]3d0g> normally equatorial mounts
1298400896: <]3d0g> pivot on axis, in other words.
1298400913: <tinfoil> Oh
1298400924: <tinfoil> No, was looking for a dolly - something on a track
1298400932: <tinfoil> on axis will work in addition to that

1298419145: <ATLchan> wassup
1298419169: <ATLchan> 1$CAN > 1$US
1298419173: <ATLchan> freaky
1298419192: <ATLchan> they've got a relatively single payer health care system too
1298419246: <tinfoil> http://sinisterbrain.com/video.html - Long exposure timelapse photography converted to a video
1298419246: <PipSqueek> http://goo.gl/eS7rt (Motion Blur Time Lapse)
1298419246: <tinfoil> NSFW
1298419272: <ATLchan> dude.  your girlfriend should eat more
1298419275: * ATLchan runs away
1298419291: <tinfoil> Kick your ass :-)
1298419307: <ATLchan> ooo spank me and make me call you daddy, too
1298419314: <tinfoil> Deal.  :-p
1298419317: <ATLchan> that's awesome
1298419322: <ATLchan> the vid i mean
1298419332: <ATLchan> kinda scared at how quick you said deal
1298419349: <ATLchan> it reminds me of a tool video prior to processing 
1298419379: <tinfoil> Considering the level of effort I put into it, yeah.. the tool video wouldn't be hard to achieve if I could make the sets
1298419387: <tinfoil> (next to no effort really)
1298419406: <tinfoil> I need to break out my bass and make music 
1298419418: <ATLchan> you can do photoshop-like filtration to "pencil" or "brushstroke" videos these days eh?
1298419438: <ATLchan> like the ah ha video without requiring a super computer
1298419444: <ATLchan> or hand drawing cells
1298419486: <ATLchan> it's pretty cool.  got a job offer today that was hard to turn down
1298419507: <ATLchan> if they had the position in nyc area, i would have given my tw notice right then and there
1298419514: <tinfoil> Oh, the brush-stroke thing would be easy
1298419517: <tinfoil> what kind of job?
1298419530: <tinfoil> In Atlanta, eh?
1298419541: <ATLchan> unix administration with a secondary of security and compliance
1298419547: <tinfoil> nice!
1298419586: <ATLchan> "i'm amazed you not only know your product but unix, too.  you even run linux as the host os. most consultants we get in here spend 1/2 each day on the phone to tech support"
1298419606: <ATLchan> always good to hear shit like that when you're feeling bleh
1298419646: <ATLchan> yah.  atlanta is uber suck
1298419662: <tinfoil> I'd rather live in DC
1298419665: <tinfoil> and that's saying a lot
1298419670: <ATLchan> haha
1298419676: <ATLchan> this suburb is almost all korean
1298419681: <tinfoil> Good food?
1298419689: <ATLchan> i'm not that into korean
1298419711: <ATLchan> food that is
1298419714: <ATLchan> o_O
1298419719: <ATLchan> O_o
1298419732: <tinfoil> I haven't had korean in a while.
1298419737: <tinfoil> Food that is
1298419817: <ATLchan> i need out
1298419845: <ATLchan> the travel has finally gotten to be a drag and i'm feeling burned out
1298419872: <tinfoil> You said that last year... and I believe the year before
1298419880: <tinfoil> I agree though
1298419884: <tinfoil> I'd like to see you free
1298419890: <ATLchan> all work.  no play. seriously dull
1298419903: <ATLchan> got bank but no incentive to use it
1298419919: <ATLchan> and the idea of traveling for vacation is laughable when you travel for work
1298419945: <ATLchan> got any good resume templates?
1298419959: <ATLchan> i have one of your old ones from a gazillion years back
1298419971: <tinfoil> My resume that I haven't updated in like 3-4 years?
1298419978: <tinfoil> Check your gmail should be in there
1298419983: <ATLchan> i got that
1298421947: <ATLchan> damn.  got another job offer
1298421968: <ATLchan> remember tom defelice?  he's security manager at bjs wholesale and wanted me to move up to MA
1298421985: <tinfoil> How do you like MA?
1298421996: <tinfoil> I remmeber him, but don't remember where I know him from
1298422003: <ATLchan> GTP
1298422014: <ATLchan> he was in the curtis dalton gang
1298422387: <tinfoil> I don't remember much with GTP these days
1298422409: <ATLchan> i made some good connections through people there
1298422414: <ATLchan> so i try to keep up with everyone
1298422681: <tinfoil> I made basic connections with like 3 people
1298423844: <tinfoil> Than again, your time at GTP did seem much more...productive
1298470777: <NoiseReducer> tinfoil: you around?
1298472678: <fbx> oi all
1298473935: <ATLchan> dp gave up being dp?
1298473943: <ATLchan> fascist
1298474130: --- NoiseReducer is now known as dp
1298474139: <dp> I'm considering putting that as my job title
1298474448: <ATLchan> a little less risque in the alternate meanings too
1298474662: <dp> wait, what?
1298474699: <dp> ATLchan: you know the only thing I have trouble with in e16? I can't resize windows via the title bar
1298475875: <ATLchan> yah. that may be an artifact of the lightone theme
1298475888: <ATLchan> i've been using it so long i really don't know what the default behavior is anymore

1298481529: <fbx> dp: you know...alternate meanings. as in, not "Darkness Productions".
1298481534: <fbx> don't make me elaborate

1298481708: <fbx> skipped right on up from "two in the pink, one in the stink", did ya acr0nym ?
1298481818: <]3d0g> passed minivan too
1298481914: <fbx> that should be called the shocker instead
1298481928: <fbx> i'm pretty sure a fist is a lot harder to miss than a finger
1298481936: <]3d0g> why? 2 in front, 5 in the rear makes total sense.
1298481950: <fbx> well, true
1298482003: <fbx> if i do that while being white and living in the burbs, is that considered minivan gangsta?
1298482244: <dp> wtf is DVDA?
1298482251: <acr0nym> double vaginal double anal
1298482254: <dp> wow
1298482257: <dp> jesus christ
1298482279: <]3d0g> naw, kinda doubt he did it.
1298482292: <acr0nym> Oh, no, I'm just saying I like the initialism.
1298482307: <]3d0g> he = JC
1298482316: <acr0nym> Hah!
1298482323: <acr0nym> I dunno, he was friends with lotsa whores.  He prolly did.
1298482376: <]3d0g> you MAY need to get out more dp. Hell, you can find DVDA @ Blockbuster.
1298482437: <fbx> orgasmo is a blockbuster? wow
1298482459: <dp> *that* makes me think of DVD-Audio
1298482461: * dp sad
1298482485: <]3d0g> DVDA audio is usually quite loud.
1298482541: <fbx> i'm betting double vag double anal is too
1298482558: * fbx has done a lot of things, but not that
1298482619: <dp> I'd rather not do that
1298482627: <dp> that's 3 more dicks around me than I'd prefer
1298482643: <]3d0g> indeed
1298482646: <fbx> so you're dick enough, is what you're saying?
1298482706: <dp> if that's the way you want to take it, sure
1298482721: <fbx> cuz that's not what your <fill in this blank> said

1298482947: <dp> I'm *seriously* considering thieving this other LCD in the back corner, and trying to make it work with e
1298482953: <fbx> what vid card runs that, ]3d0g ?
1298482993: <fbx> or is this more than one machine and you're snaking us

1298483073: <]3d0g> Nvidia Quadro NVS 450
1298483154: <]3d0g> 8 core dell, 24G ram.

1298483576: <TeleCon> no
1298483599: <]3d0g> but I need a new uber-remote.
1298483614: <TeleCon> Let me refine my answer
1298483618: <TeleCon> No, I won't discuss.
1298483632: <]3d0g> fine, go back to the YMCA with the boys.
1298483652: <acr0nym> For your iPod?
1298483652: <TeleCon> Maybe later.
1298483671: <]3d0g> Got a Touch languishing acr0.
1298483676: <acr0nym> I mean iPad....
1298483687: <acr0nym> Oh, yeah, might work okay then.
1298483688: <acr0nym> Heh.
1298483702: <acr0nym> Is the headphone jack on the top
1298483702: <acr0nym> ?

1298484035: --> griffigr (gregg@dp-5850099B.static.insightbb.com) has joined #lobby
1298484053: <griffigr> hey; I'm a friend of dp's. I want to discuss politics with you fbx
1298484064: <acr0nym> Dammit, I thought we decided NOT more people.
1298484073: <acr0nym> Heh.
1298484076: <griffigr> Tickles
1298484084: <griffigr> Sorry...
1298484086: <griffigr> Glen wrote that
1298484091: <griffigr> but, fuck it
1298484096: <griffigr> let's talk politics
1298484104: <dp> griffigr isn't a person; griffigr is a right-wing conspiracy theorist who thinks Obama is the "beast from the sea"
1298484117: <griffigr> Book of Revelation, son!
1298484119: <dp> we've been discussing politics in the office, and I decided to pull him in here
1298484128: <griffigr> ...because...
1298484130: <griffigr> i'm fucking crazy
1298484133: <griffigr> apparently
1298484134: <griffigr> :D
1298484169: <-- griffigr (gregg@dp-5850099B.static.insightbb.com) has left #lobby
1298484172: <dp> fbx must be busy
1298484179: --> griffigr (gregg@dp-5850099B.static.insightbb.com) has joined #lobby
1298484204: <TeleCon> So it would seem.
1298484231: <]3d0g> OK, politics. Let's discuss the Middle East position and it's pros / cons .vs. doggie-style.
1298484232: <griffigr> Reagan's "Trickle Down Economics" kicked ass..
1298484244: <griffigr> systematic repression of the poor for the win!
1298484261: <dp> griffigr doesn't like doggie-style; he's completely "conservative missionary style"
1298484274: <griffigr> missionary rules
1298484282: <griffigr> you can hold her arms down so she can't escape
1298484283: <griffigr> hahahaha
1298484286: <]3d0g> and minivan?
1298484308: <griffigr> no
1298484311: <griffigr> windowless panel van
1298484321: <griffigr> if there's no witnesses, it never happened
1298484356: <]3d0g> 5 in the rear does not go unnoticed, I'd imagine.
1298484374: <dp> heh; that's another new one on me
1298484386: <griffigr> hahahaha
1298484404: <dp> so serious politics. explain to griffigr "why" Obama is likely meeting with Zuck, Jobs, etc
1298484442: <griffigr> a liberal president aligning himself with liberal tech leaders?
1298484445: <griffigr> conspiracy!
1298484483: <]3d0g> To get access to bitches private FB albums, of course.
1298484508: <dp> speaking of which; did you hear about the new FB app that would alert you when someone's relationship status changes?
1298484516: <griffigr> see?!
1298484522: <griffigr> fucking Stalker Central, dude
1298484551: <dp> I'd go more along the lines that he's meeting with the largest tech companies in the US
1298484562: <dp> s/largest/fastest growing/;
1298484568: <TeleCon> To prevent an egypt like uprising in the US?
1298484570: <TeleCon> What?
1298484578: <dp> lol
1298484690: <griffigr> egyptians without internet = gyptians
1298484698: <griffigr> yes, i'm unoriginal
1298484702: <griffigr> still funny as shit, though
1298484719: <TeleCon> What about Libyans without internet?
1298484727: <TeleCon> Still bleeding.

1298484947: <dp> lol
1298484955: <]3d0g> Deja poo.
1298485010: <fbx> indeed
1298485025: <fbx> so i am here, just not paying that much attention
1298485044: <dp> fbx: scrollback to when griffigr joined
1298485063: <fbx> apparently, dp tires of not being able to defend his political views? ;)
1298485065: <fbx> yeah, i saw
1298485074: <fbx> he's a regular teahadist
1298485075: <dp> that too
1298485080: <fbx> good for him
1298485095: <dp> though, I *don't* believe he's a birther
1298485100: <dp> another guy we work with is though
1298485107: <fbx> awesome
1298485122: <fbx> tell me...where was john mccain born again?
1298485131: <fbx> wasn't here in the states
1298485146: <TeleCon> He wasn't born.
1298485188: * ]3d0g doesn't believe reliable birth records were kept that far back.
1298485198: <fbx> birther views are just tiring, as there's no convincing them otherwise. it's dogma, really. i applaud them for their utter closemindedness.
1298485208: <TeleCon> For information about how John McCain came into being please see http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/slime_mold.html
1298485209: <PipSqueek> http://goo.gl/vUCHP (slime mold)
1298485216: <dp> lol
1298485225: <griffigr> he descended from the Heavens
1298485233: <griffigr> riding on the palm of Jesus
1298485234: <griffigr> duh!
1298485261: <fbx> jesus didn't have palms, dude....those are holes.
1298485265: <fbx> where palms used to be
1298485268: <TeleCon> Of course that applies to all politicians, including both Pauls
1298485278: <TeleCon> That's why he is so holy.
1298485293: <griffigr> blasphemous..
1298485295: <dp> hey, I think Rand could actually be good for Kentucky, but that's just my IMHO
1298485296: <griffigr> yet entertaining
1298485309: <griffigr> it's because he's a badass Republican
1298485312: <fbx> which, technically, isn't how people were crucified then anyway. nails woulda slipped through the hands with all that weight. nasty.
1298485328: <]3d0g> they in-breed in Kentucky, right?
1298485334: <griffigr> yes
1298485345: <griffigr> Sister-fucking rednecks abound
1298485347: <]3d0g> awesome.
1298485350: <fbx> wait, i thought repubs believed in larger govt? isn't rand the opposite?
1298485361: <TeleCon> Well, Ron Paul might have asexual reproduction of some sort.
1298485367: <dp> griffigr: what about Brother-fucking rednecks?
1298485370: <griffigr> true republicans advocate little government control
1298485377: <fbx> he's full of the mitochondria!
1298485391: <fbx> or something
1298485402: <TeleCon> Too bad there are only one or 2 true republicans that are electable.
1298485419: <TeleCon> The rest all became unelecatable by joining the LP.
1298485428: <griffigr> yeah, i'm bummed about the Governator, too...
1298485443: <griffigr> he SO should have been born in the U.S.
1298485639: <]3d0g> He could have Kuato for VP.
1298485713: <dp> wait, the baby-head dude from Total Recall?
1298485730: <]3d0g> yup
1298485747: <dp> also, the Governator is a crock. A "Repub" who married a "Dem", but lives and works in California
1298485759: <]3d0g> No worse than Palin, amirite?
1298485763: <griffigr> i want the triple-breasted chick to be in charge of the Treasury
1298485787: <dp> well, afaik, Palin hasn't said "Quaid.... Quaid...."
1298485817: <]3d0g> No, more like Todd... Todd...
1298487012: <ATLchan> i do not want to know what palin's O face or O voice is
1298487040: <]3d0g> You sure? I'm confident rule 34 exists on that...
1298487079: <ATLchan> without question.  how many dipshits voted their dick?
1298487094: <ATLchan> prolly more for palin than for nixon
1298487110: <]3d0g> on parity with those that voted with their religion, methinks.
1298487120: <ATLchan> and skin color
1298487161: <ATLchan> mccain's concession speech audience looked like a cross between a klan meeting and a southern white debutantes ball
1298487209: <]3d0g> mix in a little fundie chrisitan speaking in tongues and you got it.
1298487775: <griffigr> Problem?
1298487807: <griffigr> I'd nail Palin
1298487838: <griffigr> and I would have much rather have McCain as president
1298487890: <griffigr> Catering to the poor and/or minority groups isn't a way to dig ourselves out of a recession
1298488111: <tinfoil> I wouldn't mind McCain of 12 years ago as president
1298488141: <tinfoil> McCain of now feels like silly putty that someone else has been working over
1298488165: <griffigr> his shoulders still need a little work
1298488168: <griffigr> ZING!
1298488632: <ATLchan> i was a mccainy when he was primary-ing littlebush
1298488637: <ATLchan> he went senile after that
1298488643: <ATLchan> not that he was that rational before hand
1298488665: <tinfoil> If we locked Palin in a room with the US citizenship test and a weeks worth of food and water only to let her out when she passed the test - she's starve to death
1298488708: <dp> so would most americans
1298488716: <tinfoil> dp:  Agreed, sadly
1298488740: <fbx> so i'm curious as to how griffigr thinks we dig our way out of this recession then
1298488748: <tinfoil> dp:  Still, that should be a vetting process for anyone who wants to run for government in this country
1298488775: <dp> agreed
1298488801: <dp> disclaimer: griffigr is 27, has never been married, has no kids
1298488819: <tinfoil> News Caster:  "Aparently [political candidate] didn't pass the citcenship test before he died of malnutrition - Oh well"
1298488826: <dp> lol
1298488836: <tinfoil> Wow, only one typo there.  :-)
1298488846: <ATLchan> seriously fuck you for saying married and kids makes a difference.  as if us non married non kid having folks cant be rational and altruistic
1298488887: <fbx> way to be....rational, there, ATLchan 
1298488889: <fbx> ;)
1298488892: <tinfoil> ATLchan: If anything, we don't have to balance our family life to do our job
1298488893: <ATLchan> how many times have i personally seen "hey man i got a family" as justification for ethics violations at work
1298488927: <fbx> true...having a family invites a breed of desperation ATLchan wouldn't probably ever have
1298488952: <ATLchan> shit you should see me after a few beers
1298488953: <griffigr> this reminds me of a NOFX song
1298488966: <tinfoil> Isn't there a documented cognative dissonence assiociated with morals and family values?
1298488967: <fbx> i got a friend who's convince his job is going away. he's thinking of moving back to canada with his wife and kid (to where some family lives)
1298488981: <griffigr> "...and when she shot that family and moved into their home, the paper said she suffered from dementia..."
1298488987: <fbx> i piss on the term family values
1298488992: <tinfoil> Lets say starving kid steals to feed his sick sibling.  
1298489005: <dp> ATLchan: not suggesting that having a family or kids makes one better than another
1298489014: <dp> just making a disclaimer
1298489016: <fbx> what a crock of utter bullshit proto-religious conservative positions
1298489045: <tinfoil> fbx: Get off your fucking podium, I wasn't using it like the republicans do
1298489047: <tinfoil> :-0
1298489048: <griffigr> as opposed to what other "positions?"
1298489049: <tinfoil> :-)
1298489067: <fbx> tinfoil: fuck you man XD
1298489074: <griffigr> atheist, liberal positions?
1298489075: <fbx> hehehe
1298489076: <ATLchan> kama sutra have an android app yet?
1298489081: <tinfoil> I mean - It's amazing how many moral and ethical decisions change when people percieve their family is affected
1298489101: <tinfoil> ATLchan: More likely on android than iphone .  :-)
1298489118: <fbx> griffigr: i know quite a few atheists who have a better grip on morals than some of the churchgoers i call friends
1298489136: <griffigr> oh, i'm not disagreeing..
1298489146: <griffigr> just asking you to qualify the statement
1298489198: <griffigr> i know a lot of scumbag, so-called, "Christians."
1298489206: <dp> some of them work here
1298489214: <griffigr> i know a lot of scumbag atheists, too
1298489217: <griffigr> HAHAHAHAH
1298489220: <griffigr> no kidding
1298489453: <fbx> i'm just calling the Moral Majority rightist social conservative group of "family values" a crock of shit, created by the likes of falwell, dobson and perkins. 
1298489483: <fbx> with a label created to invoke a certain type of thinking. that's all.
1298489589: <griffigr> I'm inclined to agree with not conforming to a pre-defined standard of thought...and living..
1298489601: * fbx gives podium back to tinfoil 
1298489607: <fbx> sorry
1298489611: <griffigr> hahaha
1298489676: <griffigr> but, really...if you're simply speaking out against the conformity of it all, shouldn't the logic apply to topics outside of family?
1298489743: <fbx> no, i'm not speaking out against the conformity of the term, but the specifics of mindset one has to have to believe all that crap fits together
1298489824: <griffigr> so, you're against Utilitarian principles?
1298489852: <griffigr> what's good for your is, well, good for you..
1298489860: <griffigr> *you
1298489871: <griffigr> and what's good for me is good for ME
1298490347: <fbx> i think you may be inferring a few things, the first of which is that the moral positions staked out in what social conservatives call "family values" is, in fact, related to utilitarianism. i don't see any felicific calculus involved in created such a set of positions. i do, however, see a group of religious dogmatics attempting to instill their version of morality by giving it the wolf's clothing of the term "family values".
1298490538: <fbx> but hey...what the fuck do i know?
1298490592: <dp> heh. until I googled that term, I swore you'd made it up, or mis-spelled it
1298490628: <fbx> well, he brought up utilitarianism, so...
1298490648: <fbx> well, utilitarian principles
1298490659: <dp> got a link for reading up?
1298490702: <fbx> i did have to go back and make sure it was spelled right, if that's what you mean ;)
1298490721: <griffigr> fucking ethics 101, yo
1298490735: <fbx> john stuart mill was an economist, so i've heard of the term more than once
1298490735: <griffigr> i'm just saying...
1298490752: <griffigr> you decide what's right for you..
1298490758: <griffigr> and i'll decide what's right for me
1298490764: <griffigr> or, in short, we'll agree to disagree
1298490766: <griffigr> or whatever
1298490773: <fbx> ethics 101...now THERE'S something our elected officials should probably have to pass
1298490789: <griffigr> hahaha
1298490792: <griffigr> no kidding
1298490835: <TeleCon> There is no way I am reading all that scroll.
1298490839: <fbx> griffigr: we hardly disagree, so it' probably hard for you to argue in favor of so-called "family values"
1298490840: <TeleCon> Someone summarize for me.
1298490879: <dp> lol
1298490901: <acr0nym> TeleCon: It's like this:
1298490902: <fbx> TeleCon: griffigr and i think the positions espoused in socio-conservative "family values" are a crock as a group and guiding philosophy
1298490915: <acr0nym> griffigr: "Blah, blah, blah."  fbx: "Blah, blah, blah."
1298490916: <dp> wait, so you both agree?
1298490916: <fbx> i think that's about it
1298490924: <griffigr> yes
1298490926: <fbx> acr0nym: hehe
1298490931: <fbx> dp: on that, sure
1298490933: <dp> I need to re-read, cause I didn't see that
1298490963: <dp> fbx: link for reading up on utilitarianism principles?
1298490976: <griffigr> dude
1298490988: <fbx> he said "what's good for you is good for you, what's good for me is good for me" in the context of the term family values, anyway. i agreed.
1298490994: <griffigr> read the passages written by philospher James Rachels
1298491013: <tinfoil> Wooo, my external RAID5 4x 2Tb enclosure arrived
1298491015: <griffigr> he makes the most sense for utilitarianism in my opinion
1298491040: <fbx> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism
1298491040: <PipSqueek> http://goo.gl/j5s41 (Utilitarianism Wikipedia the free encyclopedia)
1298491040: <fbx> there's your all-purpose start, i guess
1298491078: <griffigr> and how the fuck i remembered James Rachels from my freshman year of college is beyond me
1298491098: <fbx> i think he and dr kevorkian probably had a beer or two together
1298491099: <dp> meh, I never took a philosophy class in college.
1298491113: <griffigr> i was inundated with them
1298491127: <dp> that's because you went to a public school
1298491131: <griffigr> so boring
1298491145: <dp> my degree didn't require them, so I didn't take them
1298491147: <griffigr> i went to a liberal arts college
1298491148: <dp> now, I wish I had
1298491153: <griffigr> fucking hippies
1298491191: <fbx> heh
1298491205: * fbx has hair beyond his shoulders at this point
1298491215: <fbx> and listens to the dead
1298491231: <griffigr> don't be hatin' on my weave, bro
1298491250: <fbx> actually, what does qualify has hippie these days anyway?
1298491256: <griffigr> smelling like shit?
1298491270: <griffigr> finding the beauty in retarded bullshit?
1298491286: <fbx> c'mon...beauty is everywhere
1298491289: <fbx> so is fugly
1298491293: <griffigr> hahaha
1298491305: <griffigr> yes, but hippies take that shit to the extreme
1298491319: <griffigr> there is NOTHING beautiful about, say, linoleum
1298491334: <griffigr> but a hippie will find something positive to say about it
1298491335: <fbx> i see you've never taken acid
1298491343: <griffigr> no sir, i have not
1298491364: <griffigr> there are dragons in the kitchen!
1298491413: <dp> demons and zombies too!
1298491472: <griffigr> http://bit.ly/dOGmrS
1298491472: <PipSqueek> http://bit.ly/dOGmrS -- 
1298491496: <dp> griffigr: PipSqueek automagically shortens urls for us, so you don't have to ;)
1298491529: <fbx> griffigr: first sentence, wikipedia: Linoleum (informally abbreviated to lino) is a floor covering made from renewable materials such as solidified linseed oil (linoxyn), pine rosin, ground cork dust, wood flour, and mineral fillers such as calcium carbonate, most commonly on a burlap or canvas backing; pigments are often added to the materials.
1298491543: <fbx> renewable? that's BEAUTIFUL!!!
1298491555: <dp> haha
1298491568: <griffigr> BAH!
1298491618: <acr0nym> Also, linoleum can be plenty beautiful.  Most people just don't want that kind of distraction for their floors.
1298491659: <griffigr> must invoke the rule of Utilitarianism on this one
1298491665: <]3d0g> Christ. Today's the tl;dr edition of #lobby.
1298491671: <griffigr> hahaha
1298491675: <TeleCon> Big time
1298491678: <dp> it can also be non-distracting... just get you a very simple pattern
1298491690: <griffigr> italian tile > linoleum
1298491692: <]3d0g> like dongs.
1298491711: <fbx> they have a dong pattern for linoleum floors?
1298491712: <dp> it's funny, the very first time I saw tl;dr, I thought it meant 'top left; down right'
1298491718: <fbx> nice
1298491721: <griffigr> css
1298491726: <dp> worked well enough for me
1298491829: <griffigr> i am curious what a penis-patterned linoleum floor would look like, though
1298491980: <dp> [15:08]  fbx| they have a dong pattern for linoleum floors?

1298493723: <TeleCon> I knew what you meant.
1298493826: <tinfoil> We just failed an audit, so we're overcompensating

1298578838: <dp> ok guys; question. my motherboard has DSUB and DVI out. any chance I can use them simultaneously to drive 2 monitors?
1298578850: <acr0nym> Probably.
1298578867: <dp> any idea how?
1298578888: <acr0nym> Plug a monitor into each one?
1298578902: <dp> yeah, I get the same screen on both
1298578903: <acr0nym> if it works, Windows and/or Ubuntu tends to detect it quite automagically.
1298578915: <dp> afaik, they're driven by the same card
1298578933: <acr0nym> Right, but it's "clone" vs. "extend" setting for the desktop, somewhere.

1298579788: <acr0nym> dp: I think it's easier than that, now, actually.  Just look at the display settings.
1298579934: <fbx> Thunderbolt has an 8ns latency over 7 daisy-chained devices? that's not bad.
1298580053: <dp> acr0nym: any idea where? I'm running e, so I don't have the standard display settings

1298580663: <dp> yep
1298580671: <acr0nym> Good, good.

1298918373: <tinfoil> Woo
1298918375: <tinfoil> I'm back
1298918391: <fbx> ...and there was much rejoicing!
1298918393: <tinfoil> Rebuilt my office workstation from linux to win7 :-(
1298918402: <fbx> 32b or 64b?
1298918417: <tinfoil> 64.  32 Wouldn't use even 1/4 of this machine
1298918460: <fbx> i don't mind my win7 64b lappy
1298918478: <fbx> not sure i'd take it to, say, defcon, but...it's not terrible
1298918619: <fbx> tinfoil: your thoughts on win7?
1298918661: <tinfoil> I've loved it for several years now
1298918690: <tinfoil> I prefer Ubuntu strongly, but win7 is competent for MS
1298918701: <tinfoil> Nothing like Vista, XP, 98, 95, or 3.1
1298918934: <TeleCon> If I could get a decent gnome-terminal in win7, I could probably use it.
1298918935: <tinfoil> I have both cygwin and virtualbox installed
1298918962: <tinfoil> That's your problem, you expect a decent gnome-terminal, something that doesn't exist even on linux.  ;-)
1298918975: <tinfoil> mintty for cygwin has great emulation
1298919010: <tinfoil> Most native linux users skip it and use one of the linux terms they are used to
1298919024: <tinfoil> If you have cyg, check it out :-)
1298919534: <dp> tinfoil: sure it does; xterm is great
1298919538: <dp> er
1298919542: <dp> s/xterm/urxvt/;
1298919724: <tinfoil> I like urxvt - but it's not gnome-terminal
1298919778: <dp> that's because it's better
1298919834: <tinfoil> Yeah, I'm just saying that you can't expect a decent gnome-terminal because it doesn't exist
1298919840: <tinfoil> urxvt isn't gnome terminal
1298919855: <TeleCon> I like the ability to click links in my terminal.
1298919890: <tinfoil> That's not limited to gnome-terminal
1298919894: <tinfoil> urxvt can do that :-0
1298919895: <TeleCon> And ctrl-shift-n and ctrl-shift-t
1298919903: <tinfoil> What's that?
1298919915: <TeleCon> new window and new tab.
1298919927: <tinfoil> Oh, you mean ^AC  ;-)
1298919931: * tinfoil ducks
1298919955: <tinfoil> Last comment was being a pain in the ass
1298919957: * TeleCon shakes head.
1298919971: <TeleCon> Package 'urxvt' has no installation candidate
1298919980: <tinfoil> What OS?
1298919984: <TeleCon> ubuntu
1298920024: <tinfoil> apt-cache search rxvt-unicode
1298920052: <tinfoil> No idea why they renamed the package
1298920060: <TeleCon> rxvt worked
1298920075: <tinfoil> There's several different splinters of rxvt
1298920086: <tinfoil> but yeah
1298920093: <tinfoil> It's very lightweight and yet has features
1298920141: <TeleCon> Can't click a link in it.
1298920150: <dp> why would you want to?
1298920152: <dp> it's a terminal
1298920167: <tinfoil> Hmmm, I'm curious about a mintty (cygwin) feature... urls.   http://slashdot.org/
1298920167: <PipSqueek> http://slashdot.org/ -- Slashdot News for nerds stuff that matters
1298920167: <TeleCon> links from mail, links from irc.
1298920168: <tinfoil> dammit, nope
1298920170: <dp> copy, paste
1298920179: <TeleCon> left click, click.
1298920182: <tinfoil> no
1298920186: <TeleCon> lauches chrome
1298920186: <tinfoil> You can configure it to click
1298920203: <tinfoil> Dammit, I don't have the rc code here
1298920212: <tinfoil> but you can configure most rxvt clones to regex match urls
1298920216: <TeleCon> gnome-terminal already does what I need, in the way I expect it to.
1298920240: <tinfoil> The only gripe about gt is that it's a hog
1298920244: <tinfoil> but it does work
1298920260: <tinfoil> I haven't replaced it on my two latest ubuntu builds (yet)
1298920334: <tinfoil> It's like comparing firefox vs chrome.  :-)
1298920350: <tinfoil> Both rock, one uses more resources and has more features
1298920365: <tinfoil> one is faster and more light weight
1298920425: <dp> TeleCon: in ~/.Xdefaults:
1298920432: <dp> URxvt.perl-ext-common: default,matcher
1298920435: <dp> URxvt.urlLauncher: google-chrome
1298920444: <dp> then run "xrdb ~/.Xdefaults"
1298920449: <dp> restart your terminal

1298920615: <dp> I will say, that's quite useful
1298920906: <TeleCon> So rxvt is a little lighter.
1298920922: <TeleCon> 300m for gt is not going to make a difference 
1298921172: <dp> ?
1298921247: <TeleCon> tinfoil was whinging that gnome-terminal was too heavyweight for my system.

1298930286: <acr0nym> Heh, I did that to a guy who used to work with me and ]3d0g.  The best part was that I rearranged every keyboard on his desk (Sun, PC, etc.) the same way, so he was extra confused.

1299181809: <fbx> more scared, then
1299181830: <milkchan> mostly people don't know the difference between telnet the client, telnet the act of logging in clear text for remote administration, and telnet the daemon/server
1299181844: <milkchan> and they definitely don't know how tcp ports work or anything about the 3 way handshake
1299181859: <milkchan> which if they did, they'd understand the use of telnet client AS a tcp ping like tool
1299181871: <milkchan> which wouldn't be blocked by a firewall blocking "telnet"
1299181909: <TeleCon>  netcat baby
1299182037: <fbx> most people shouldn't be in IT, then
1299182074: <fbx> if you can't tell ICMP from an ACK, do something else for a living
1299182304: <fbx> i'm just having a hard time thinking you talk to folks like that, unless the folks you talk to aren't supposed to be in IT or IT security
1299185311: <TeleCon> ACK!
1299185971: <fbx> Bill the Cat, right?
1299186065: <TeleCon> somethuing
1299186083: <TeleCon> like that
1299187364: <milkchan> if i saw netcat on a box in a pci segment i'd call the FBI
1299187390: <milkchan> that's why it's important to use available tools that are installed by default whenever possible

1299199575: <tinfoil> New window limit 
1299199579: <tinfoil> same as chrome
1299199617: <tinfoil> It works on the surface, but dig into reports and you can only open up a limited number of windows
1299199689: <tinfoil> It can be disabled, unlike chrome.  fixed.  :-)
1299199988: <milkchan> that's odd.  the only thing in TE i couldn't get to work in chrome was the slider bar between the navigation and edit panes
1299200038: <tinfoil> I get 3 windows deep and it won't open any new windows

1299249849: <milkchan> and of course, i have to then change whatever password i just dumped
1299249865: <dp> hehehe
1299249891: <dp> I use keepassx; once you paste it, it removes your password from the copy buffer

1299265147: <milkchan> i entrolled in global entry program and have already been accepted.  there's no global entry kiosks in toronto, though
1299265154: <milkchan> and you clear customs there
1299265192: <milkchan> there ARE nexus kiosks in canada, but you have to register while you're IN canada or at a canadian border location like detroit, niagra falls etc
1299268430: <dp> how do they secure NEXUS people tho?
1299268442: <tinfoil> Fucking A, dealing with indian support pisses me off
1299268455: <]3d0g> OBLIGE AND DO THE NEEDFUL, FUCKER.
1299268458: <tinfoil> I just flat out told someone he was wrong, and supplied the proof
1299268563: <tinfoil> If I'm forced to find the bug and issue the patch I'm ending my support contract and demanding they refund me
1299268964: <tinfoil> Fuck, they admitted I was right and then told me to uninstall their product :-p
1299268967: <tinfoil> Hah
1299268971: <tinfoil> Ok, will do.
1299273382: <milkchan> you have to fill out an application that's like a security clearance.  they review it, do a background check, provisionally accept you.  then you go in to get interviewed by a customs agent in person
1299273400: <milkchan> if you pass that they do fingerrprints for global entry, iris scan for nexus
1299273429: <milkchan> the systems are shared so since i'm already in global entry, the nexus paperwork was filled out almost in its entirety for me
1299273461: <milkchan> and even better, they were able to tell the moment i put my finger on the scanner, that i had a military clearance in the 90s
1299273525: <milkchan> guy looked up started asking me questions about the military to see if i'd trip up on any of the details.  he had all the info on his screen right there.  took me 5 minutes.  they grilled this other guy that travels to asia and latin america all the time for about 45 minutes
1299273671: <dp> so you iris scan anywhere there's a nexus booth to smooth on in?
1299273761: <milkchan> yep.  unfortunately for me, global entry is for when you enter the US and have to clear customs inside the borders
1299273779: <milkchan> nexus is good for clearing AT the border and those canadian airports that have US customs on their side
1299273816: <milkchan> in YYZ, i clear customs for the US there.  then when i arrive at EWR, it's like i'm getting off a domestic flight
1299273868: <milkchan> got 2 factor auth for gmail kicking

1299273962: <milkchan> did you try there recently?
1299273976: <milkchan> its under personal settings, using 2 set auth
1299273981: <milkchan> step*
1299274054: <milkchan> what sucks is you still need to gen a fixed password for the android to use as a login
1299274083: <dp> and the iphone app requires iOS4
1299274085: <dp> fuck that
1299274095: <milkchan> the authenticator?
1299274103: <dp> the app, yeah
1299274200: <milkchan> the "remember me on this computer for 30 days" seems to check your source network.  moving from the wegmans network, sprint, clearwire, and tmobile all caused me to re enter my authenticator pin
1299274214: <milkchan> even though it was the same browser string and OS
1299274351: <milkchan> was it 3dog that said baby boomers need to fucking die?
1299274370: <milkchan> crissakes.  email. text. it's like the novelty of mobile phones hasn't worn off
1299274421: <milkchan> HI I'M AT THE AIRPORT I'M ON A FUCKING CELLPHONE
1299274430: <milkchan> yes yes.  i can tell. you're screaming
1299274765: <dp> oh
1299274766: <dp> hahaha
1299275431: <dp> Each time you sign in from an unverified computer, you will be required to
1299275431: <dp> verify your identity with both a password and a verification code, which you can
1299275431: <dp> get via a mobile app, SMS text message, or phone call.
1299275540: <milkchan> yes but it probably uses a combination of real source ip (from their perspective) and browser string.  every time chrome updates, i have to reverify with chase
1299276233: <dp> interesting

1299620791: <]3d0g> OR, it accepts your beautifully crafted filter on an interface and COMPLETELY ignores it.
1299620831: <]3d0g> OR you want JUNOS to send DHCP option 43 (my latest JUNOS roadblock).

1299697297: <tinfoil> I ran gentoo on 2 boxes there for years
1299697317: <tinfoil> It's been a while since I built my own kernel though, so I wouldn't dare do that now.  :-)
1299697330: <tinfoil> Remote kernel builds/boots are always interesting
1299697405: <ATLchan> linode uses custom kernels for their xen guests.  the cool thing is no LKM support at all
1299697416: <ATLchan> you could use your own if you wanted
1299697442: <ATLchan> neat knowing one whole class of vulns is mitigated though
1299697476: <ATLchan> oh that's what i meant to ask.  do you know how to use gdb to dump info that SHOULD match the /boot/System.map?
1299697512: <dp> LKM?
1299697519: <ATLchan> loadable kernel modules
1299697547: <dp> ah
1299697554: <dp> compile it all in
1299697575: <ATLchan> do an lsmod
1299697586: <dp> oh I know
1299697595: <dp> but if you compile it all in, there's no modules to load ;)

1299875725: <]3d0g> woosh. the sound that one made going over my head.
1299875735: <acr0nym> Ah, well.
1299875735: * ATLchan blinks

1299875753: <]3d0g> sync up sometime acr0. beers are ready.
1299875754: <dp> acr0nym: actually, root beer has no caffiene typically
1299875766: <ATLchan> that's what i thought, dp
1299875771: <acr0nym> Barq's (pronounced /'b?rks/ "Barks") is an American soft drink. "Barq's" was long the name of the company's signature product, now known as Barq's Famous Olde Tyme Root Beer, a brand of root beer notable for being the first major North American root beer to contain caffeine. It has been bottled since the start of the 20th century and is currently sold by The Coca-Cola Company.

1299876974: <acr0nym> What?  This IRC #, or something even less fun?
1299876982: <ATLchan> expense reports
1299876993: <ATLchan> much less fun than an irc full of nuns
1299877058: <dp> ATLchan: write a perl script to scape mint.com, and create it for you ;)
1299877078: * ]3d0g calls Rule 34 on an irc full of nuns.
1299877091: <ATLchan> the sound one one hand fapping?
1299877117: <ATLchan> the problem is mint seriously lags actual transactions
1299877122: <ATLchan> not real time
1299877142: <ATLchan> i usually have my expense reports submitted sundays from the prior week so they get paid the next week
1299877165: <ATLchan> i'm tossing about more expenses than some people earn in salary a year so it's kinda important to be on top o things
1299877168: <dp> ok, so script directly against your CC company
1299877199: <]3d0g> I'm always having to get exceptions for letting my expenses lapse past the 6 month limit.
1299877222: <ATLchan> nutty
1299877237: <ATLchan> are they large expenses?
1299877251: <]3d0g> eh, usually a few hundred.
1299877269: <]3d0g> stupid tool only runs in IE so it's a pain to do 'em.

1299880476: <tinfoil> Setting up a VPN with a law enforcement agency, and the FW-Tech on their side gave me his gmail account to exchange info with.
1299880496: <tinfoil> I asked for his PGP key and he was like "Oh, I can't give you the preshared key until I have your firewall information"
1299880498: <ATLchan> personal or work info
1299880500: <tinfoil> Uh... No
1299880523: <tinfoil> VPN connectivity info for us and a law enforcement agency
1299880539: <tinfoil> CALEA stuff
1299880547: <ATLchan> "gave me his gmail account to exchange  info
1299880549: <ATLchan> "
1299880557: <ATLchan> that's what i meant
1299880559: <tinfoil> Yeah
1299880566: <tinfoil> For VPN stuff
1299880577: <ATLchan> so he's using gmail to exchange work/configuration info
1299880594: <tinfoil> Yeah
1299880600: <tinfoil> and unencrypted at that
1299880603: * ATLchan snorts
1299880620: <tinfoil> He had no clue what PGP is based upon his reaction to my question
1299880762: <ATLchan> the calea stuff freaks me out. at least comcast refused them direct access to the pipes
1299880781: <tinfoil> Yeah, we don't give them direct access either
1299880788: <tinfoil> most ISP grade stuff is set up for it now
1299880804: <tinfoil> we give you X info, and only until the supena expiration date
1299880817: <tinfoil> everything is set to auto-expire
1299880831: <ATLchan> yeah.  that's fair.  a lot of shops just say "sure stick a sniffer wherever the fuck you want.  we don't hae the staff to do it for you"
1299880858: <tinfoil> They have diode-like access to our calea dedicated network - we send they recieve.  If they stop recieving they call
1299880863: <tinfoil> They can't sent anything to us
1299880885: <ATLchan> the problem with comcast's abuse dept is the people running the sniffers were slimbags
1299880893: <ATLchan> and were often caught snooping their neighbors
1299880909: <ATLchan> so you're fucked one way or another
1299880916: <ATLchan> best to use an ISP where no one knows you
1299880928: <tinfoil> The irony is that when they assigned me to take over that stuff it was between me and one other person - He's about as paranoid as I am
1299880938: <tinfoil> "Are you sure you want to give this to us?"
1299880962: <ATLchan> you using niksuns or something else?
1299880979: <tinfoil> Something else
1299881110: <ATLchan> that could get sticky if you have almost no backhaul and hand off to other carriers close to every tower
1299881169: <ATLchan> just in the number of probe points
1299881373: <tinfoil> I won't say how it's configured

1300124312: <tinfoil> uh
1300124313: <tinfoil> fuck you
1300124322: <tinfoil> Even my legal counsel says no
1300124420: <dp> hahaha
1300124464: <]3d0g> I usually use e-mail for phase 1/2 configs and require a phone call to exchange the key and test.
1300124494: <tinfoil> I have no problems with key exchange over the phone
1300124495: <dp> PGP/GPG key exchange!
1300124497: <tinfoil> that's the plan
1300124511: <tinfoil> but I asked the dude for pgp because I'm not sending VPN config data through google
1300124515: <tinfoil> plain text
1300124518: <tinfoil> he didn't even know what PGP was
1300124524: <dp> awesome
1300124542: <tinfoil> He responded with "we'll exchange the preshared key over the phone"
1300124557: <tinfoil> I'm being a dick here, but right now my legal counsel has my back
1300124571: <]3d0g> but VPN config is hardly sensitive, except for the key
1300124584: <tinfoil> We have a dedicated firewall for Calea
1300124621: <tinfoil> Yes, its public, but my management doesn't want everyone knowing what it is
1300124630: <tinfoil> It has a public IP I mean
1300124657: <tinfoil> I think I'll exchange the info with the agent in charge
1300124710: <tinfoil> Someone says they are from the FBI and wants you to open up a tunnel to them... but here's my gmail address
1300124715: <tinfoil> how would you react?

1300125758: <fbx> i've only ever sent 1 key to someone in email

1300126530: <tinfoil> ?
1300126534: <fbx> yep
1300126574: <fbx> only in a pinch, and i told him i was going to invalidate the key by the next workday (that next Monday)
1300126607: <dp> your CIO knows what PGP is?
1300126624: <fbx> and that there's a PGP AND a GPG
1300126634: <fbx> special, eh?
1300126660: <dp> holy *shit*
1300126681: <tinfoil> dp:  It's not that odd if your CIO is qualified
1300126724: <fbx> we've also talked about encrypting the laptops with full PGP or TrueCrypt...he understands what that means (or pretends to)
1300126796: <dp> tinfoil: interestingly, we don't even have a CIO, so it doesn't matter
1300128734: <fbx> dp: who's your meatshield against the business lines?

1300289363: <]3d0g> suck
1300289373: <]3d0g> we get matched 2/3s in each check
1300289394: <dp> can work out in my favor though, because of the current stock market, means I get more shares
1300289395: <]3d0g> just got our bonuses too. company paid out 136%
1300289404: <fbx> ]3d0g: up to what % of pay?
1300289444: <fbx> dp: you only have company stock as the 401k choice? 
1300289453: <]3d0g> individual bonus % are based on position. But whatever one's bonus was, they got 136% of it.
1300289472: <fbx> no - the match
1300289477: <dp> fbx: no; money goes to a fund company
1300289483: <fbx> they match 2/3 up to what %?
1300289488: <]3d0g> oh for matching? up to the fed limit
1300289490: <dp> we determine where money gets placed
1300289501: <fbx> dp: got it
1300289506: <dp> then, once per year, the company pays in the match
1300289517: <fbx> we're 50% up to 6% of pay, no match after that
1300289526: <dp> but, with so many stocks trading low right now, it's worth "
1300289527: <fbx> but i'm up 50% every pay period
1300289528: <fbx> :)
1300289528: <dp> more" shares
1300289539: <]3d0g> I just have all my 401K tossed into SPYDR.

1300289621: <fbx> straight away, or after x years?
1300289625: <]3d0g> think my 401K just crossed 200K

1300289810: <fbx> i was a moron and didn't do the 401k for a couple of years to start, so i've prolly been in that for 4.5 or so

1300289956: <dp> whether I get a company match on all of it or not
1300289982: <]3d0g> mrs doesn't work and we toss the annual max in a plan for her too

1300295955: <tinfoil> Or this week
1300295994: <tinfoil> They have a goal of becoming more of a social-networking shopping site, so they let people friend each other, etc, etc
1300296011: <tinfoil> one of the things they did was publish everyone's shopping history and their full names on their profiles
1300296018: <tinfoil> and not only let firends see it
1300296025: <tinfoil> but the public, google, and other search engines
1300296058: <tinfoil> To add icing to the cake, people also sell their hand made sex toys on Etsy
1300296080: <tinfoil> so anyone who bought them suddenly had their name and sex toy preferences published to the internet
1300296092: <tinfoil> Etsy didn't notify anyone of the change - it was discovered
1300296100: <fbx> nice
1300296110: <fbx> i smell a lawsuit
1300296179: <tinfoil> depends on their terms of service, but yeah, it won't be pretty

1300296224: <tinfoil> That's the salon article
1300296225: <fbx> i would think that's a huge change in ToS, and unless you agreed to a new banner page when you logged in after said change, they may be screwed
1300296544: <hoamchan> unilateral disclosure of information without advanced warning, tos or otherwise, probably violates statutes in california and maybe mass
1300296567: <hoamchan> everyone else is screwed with no recourse though
1300296582: <hoamchan> you can push for an apology, but good luck getting anything more
1300296612: <hoamchan> what i don't understand is why the MOVIE rental federal law was never extended to all purchases
1300296710: <hoamchan> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Privacy_Protection_Act  -- your rentals are more protected than any other form of purchase or consumer "consumption."

1300301988: <acr0nym> Uh.
1300301992: <acr0nym> I'm gonna need more context....
1300301996: <acr0nym> Which one are you talking about?
1300302018: <tinfoil> It talks about human preference the aeron chair how when it was released nobody liked it but years later it caught on
1300302095: <acr0nym> Oh, uh.  Beats me.  It's Malcolm Gladwell....
1300302154: <acr0nym> I wanna say that one was a keynote at SXSW, from around the time "Blink" came out.
1300302165: <acr0nym> That topic is thoroughly discussed in Blink.
1300302215: <tinfoil> hrm
1300302217: <tinfoil> Thanks
1300302219: <tinfoil> That's helpful
1300302227: <acr0nym> I can probably find the actual recording, if you want.
1300302305: <tinfoil> I wanted to see if I could find the post it came from and use it as a reference.
1300302379: <acr0nym> Okay, should be this one: http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail478.html#

1300302562: <acr0nym> Also, I can provide you with a non-legal copy of, umm, all of Gladwell's books that I'm aware of.

1300303014: <dp> I actually read a sample of one of gladwell's books last night
1300303021: <dp> something about the tipping point
1300303027: <dp> it was interesting
1300303028: <hoamchan> hah. the interview process is pretty nutty.  15 minutes to decide on someone you're going to have to potentially live with for 5 years
1300303029: <acr0nym> Was it called "The Tipping Point"?

1300386618: <tinfoil> but pretty cool
1300387594: <tinfoil> Man, my sago server isn't even 100% in production and I'm already loving it
1300387632: <tinfoil> pretty much, if you own a server you can exgress almost any network
1300387717: <dp> ?
1300387895: <tinfoil> One of the things I learned consulting and being behind random firewalls with random ammounts of filtering (some strict, some not)
1300387910: <tinfoil> if you have a server on the outside, most of the time you can punch a tunnel through the firewall
1300387919: <dp> ah, I get you knwo
1300387922: <dp> now
1300387923: <dp> jebus
1300387939: <tinfoil> I'm building in dnstunnel and ptunnel (icmp) now
1300387950: <tinfoil> in addition to openvpn
1300388571: <tinfoil> heh... tunneldigger for ubuntu/debian.  It allows you to centrally manage your openvpn configs, then rolls a .deb package for every host you want to connect
1300388590: <tinfoil> install the .deb it depends on openvpn, drops the config and keys in the right place and everything works
1300388593: <tinfoil> neat
1300388901: <tinfoil> whoops
1300388916: <tinfoil> chmod 0-x and chmod o-r are two very different commands
1300390372: <dp> they are
1300391731: <hoamchan> tin - even better now that you have an external host, you can set it up to always be able to reach your home machine so long as your home machine is constantly calling/called out to the external
1300391777: <hoamchan> fios still rapidly shuffles my public ip and i don't like relying on firewall holes and dynamic dns
1300391787: <hoamchan> so the home machine initiates to liverwur.st and i connect to that
1300392086: <dp> hoamchan: dyndns.org
1300392093: <dp> works well for me
1300392111: <dp> and then I set up a CNAME for home.dp.cx to it
1300394851: <tinfoil> hoamchan: Yeah, setting it up like a hub.
1300395931: <tinfoil> Doing a google map search for "pet food" near my place and they listed
1300395943: <tinfoil> "Po Dog - Gormet Hotdogs"
1300396123: <dp> blargh. I hate that php doesn't let me do $var = $x || 'a';
1300397480: <hoamchan> yah it broadcasts your location AND that you have inbound holes in your firewall though :D

1300474215: <acr0nym> Yeah, festive.
1300474562: <fbx> ]3d0g: at least we aren't fucking it up from the very start. we *did* wait for the arab league to vote no confidence in gadafi, and the resolution is to protect civilians we know are there, rather than WMDs we aren't sure are or aren't.
1300474581: <fbx> and this isn't unilateral by any stretch
1300474697: <]3d0g> we'll still fuck it up fbx. I've got faith.
1300474779: <fbx> there is always the possibility, yes
1300476882: <hoamchan> doctrine has always been to be prepared to fight two major conflicts at once but not "enjoy" it. the idea was to be able to prosecute one fully, but not be caught with the pants down if somewhere else flared up
1300476919: <hoamchan> bogged down in two major engagements for this many years was never really planned for
1300476931: <hoamchan> other than  a line item that says "don't do it"
1300476937: <hoamchan> now we're adding a third?
1300476948: <dp> what was the second?
1300476957: <hoamchan> this doesn't bode well just in terms of budgets, logistics and morale
1300476971: <hoamchan> afganistan and iraq?
1300476979: <hoamchan> they're very distinct theaters of operation
1300476983: <dp> ah
1300476998: <dp> I always considered them combined engagements
1300477031: <fbx> different command chain all the way up to theater commander, i believe
1300477093: <fbx> which makes almost everything different (logistics, units involved, etc). right, hoamchan ?
1300477097: <dp> jebus; I'm killing my box; 2 svn co's and a bzr branch running simultaneously
1300477140: <hoamchan> yah. they're only 800 miles apart but have different languages, terrain, politics, chain of command, supply chain, etc
1300477155: <hoamchan> they're prolly using two distinct carrier task forces in support even
1300477165: <dp> afghanistan and iraq don't speak arabic as a primary language?
1300477180: <hoamchan> no. afganistan is primarily pashtun i think
1300477227: <dp> huh. learn something new every day
1300477240: <hoamchan> Afghan Persian or Dari (official) 50%, Pashto (official) 35%, Turkic languages (primarily Uzbek and Turkmen) 11%, 30 minor languages (primarily Balochi and Pashai) 4%, much bilingualism
1300477255: <hoamchan> cia world fact book to the rescue
1300477262: <dp> yeah, most of the middle east is multi-lingual
1300477279: <hoamchan> Arabic (official), Kurdish (official in Kurdish regions), Turkoman (a Turkish dialect), Assyrian (Neo-Aramaic), Armenian
1300477284: <hoamchan> that's iraq's
1300477309: <hoamchan> notice very little overlap
1300477400: <hoamchan> and speaking of RSA - i really thought computer security schmucks would all be out of a job by now
1300477412: <hoamchan> all the threats having been pretty much mitigated
1300477455: <hoamchan> instead you have this glut of cissp "qualified" people on staff, millions of dollars of technology, and all the same threats

1300729261: <]3d0g> I saw Paul. Fucking funny.
1300729274: <acr0nym> Nice, it does look promising.
1300729275: <tinfoil> Tried a "Hook pull" or "energy pull" - where they put two hooks in your chest (skin only) and you pull on them 
1300729289: <acr0nym> Heh.  right.  "Whacky".
1300729289: <dp> ugh. Seth Rogan as an animated alien. Will. Suck.
1300729309: <]3d0g> why all the hate for Seth? 
1300729332: <dp> he's a terrible actor?

1300729366: <dp> he brings all his not-funny friends with him in to movies?
1300729379: <]3d0g> well the former 2 are non-issues. The latter would clearly make Paul challenging for you.
1300729416: <dp> here's my problem: take *every* "star" from Superbad. IMHO, they're *all* terrible
1300729422: <dp> both cops
1300729424: <dp> McLovin
1300729428: <dp> Jonah Hill
1300729437: <dp> the fucking Chinese dude
1300729440: <dp> *all* of them
1300729565: <tinfoil> I have a good idea
1300729574: <tinfoil> Don't watch movies you know will piss you off
1300729587: <dp> tinfoil: after Superbad and Pineapple Express, I don't
1300729598: <tinfoil> I never even heard of those two movies
1300729639: <dp> but any one of those actors will make an appearance, in an otherwise good movie, terrible for me
1300729664: <]3d0g> Paul, has much more a Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead feel, due to the cast, obviously.
1300729694: <tinfoil> I agree with ]3d0g 
1300729968: <dp> will ferrell is another of those for me
1300729982: <tinfoil> Agree with that 
1300729989: <tinfoil> Most of the SNL actors, in fact
1300729996: <tinfoil> actually, most of them don't act... my bad
1300730002: <dp> for me, Tina Fey is actually funny
1300730021: <tinfoil> Adam Sandler is great in movies that are primarely comedies
1300730027: <tinfoil> ERrrrr
1300730033: <tinfoil> that are NOT primarely comedies
1300730058: <tinfoil> If the movies attempts to be funny, he is as lame as most of the SNL alumni
1300730076: <tinfoil> Tina is okay.  She's a small well of funny though
1300732712: <tinfoil> Wow, when I started this group, there were 3 people.  We grew to 14 people (managers included) now we're down to 4.

1300735622: <]3d0g> quad 24" or GTFO.
1300735622: <dp> don't need much. I just want more screen space
1300735639: <tinfoil> 24" monitors are super cheap these days
1300735640: <dp> ]3d0g: they won't pay for something like that. I'll be lucky to get the one I'm asking for
1300736797: <dp> blargh. isn't there a way to fg a process that was backgrounded, if you don't know it's id?
1300736805: <dp> or, a way to find out the processes backgrounded
1300736978: <]3d0g> like umm, jobs?
1300737002: <dp> yeah, I found that, but it's not listing these
1300737016: <]3d0g> then just fg <job number>
1300737029: <]3d0g> but they're in the ps list?
1300737052: <dp> they're in ps auxw
1300737074: <]3d0g> and who's the owner?
1300737103: <dp> me
1300737184: <]3d0g> suspect they're spawned processes and don't belong to your shell. do they survive a logout?
1300737236: <dp> nope
1300745324: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
1300747407: <tinfoil> Hrm.  developing theory that either Ivan or I will be let go

1300748063: <hoamchan> why
1300748082: <tinfoil> funding, reorg, etc
1300748100: <tinfoil> Basically Ivan and I are the last two non-managers
1300748119: <tinfoil> everyone else quit, was laid off, or was moved elsewhere
1300748661: <hoamchan> dontcha need worker beez?

1300755377: <tinfoil> Hah, I learned something interesting
1300755417: <tinfoil> Using USC 2257 (a porn regulation) to get US hosted sites to take down illegally posted images.
1300755467: <acr0nym> stolen from you?
1300755490: <tinfoil> If they re-post sexually explicate images but don't have proof of the models age (18+) at the time they come to look for proof (not after) you can go to jail for 5+ years PER IMAGE
1300755508: <tinfoil> Not just yours, but anyones, really
1300755527: <tinfoil> It came out of a workshop I was at this weekend regarding erotic photography
1300755554: <acr0nym> Ah.
1300755566: <tinfoil> If you see your images being hosted and they are US based, fuck the DMCA takedown notice - Send a takedown notice stating that they don't have proof of the models age and CC the local police department
1300756358: <tinfoil> Dammit, I filed an emergency change control last friday.
1300756365: <tinfoil> It's been waiting for approval for 3 days now
1300756950: <tinfoil> Correction, it was filed THURSDAY

1300763725: <hoamchan> whoops
1300763725: <hoamchan> eeping requirements on a broadly defined category of producers of sexually explicit material.
1300763732: <hoamchan> damn cut and paste 
1300763767: <hoamchan> We conclude that the statute is overbroad and therefore violates the First Amendment, and
1300763771: <hoamchan> accordingly we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to enter summary

1300806833: <hoamchan> oO

1300806892: <]3d0g> heh
1300807062: <acr0nym> Jeebus.  It's just fucking IDIOT day: "He said he had java up to date and antivirus turned off. He said it is ridiculous that he needs to have his antivirus on to run the vpn and he said he believes macs do not get infected so he he sees no reason why ITS is making him use his antivirus. He wanted to talk to someone about it so he can understand more than I already explained to him.
1300807077: <acr0nym> Umm.  "Policy."  Get used to it.  It's how jobs often work.  Douche.
1300807120: <hoamchan> he has antivirus?  just doesn't want to run it?
1300807150: <acr0nym> Don't care, really.  The IT Security Office can talk to him.  They set policy.
1300807194: <acr0nym> However, I'd definitely like to send the Desktop Support Manager over to see him with a blowtorch and a pair of pliers.  Given how often the student techs have to clean virii and trojans off Macs.
1300807240: <acr0nym> Luckily, I'm CONFIDENT nobody has written a virus for Lunix, yet, so I'm running that!
1300807276: <acr0nym> FUCK, I shoulda gone back to bed.  I KNEW it.

1300808482: <tinfoil> A US F-15 downed in libia
1300808491: <tinfoil> libya too
1300808508: <tinfoil> Pilet rescued by rebels
1300808514: <tinfoil> Pilot too
1300808845: <hoamchan> it crashed. downed implies enemy action
1300808865: <tinfoil> crashed
1300808866: <tinfoil> yes
1300808884: <tinfoil> I didn't get any details yet, though just skimming
1300808887: <dp> though, the Gov't and Media are awfully quick to say that it crashed, and was not downed
1300808901: <tinfoil> I'm not looking at the media
1300808920: <tinfoil> going through an ingelligence feed

1300809075: <dp> ]3d0g: fyi; backgrounding a job is specific to the shell that opened it. even though it may continue to run in the background, 'jobs' will never see it
1300809113: <acr0nym> Weird.  I heard him being discussed yesterday by Cory Doctorow and Bill Gibson.
1300809141: <tinfoil> I found out about him through another photographer 
1300809254: <]3d0g> dp: my linux must be special
1300809270: <]3d0g> jobs shows me everything associated with that shell
1300809280: <dp> ]3d0g: right; quit the shell, and start a new one
1300809287: <dp> ' specific to the shell that opened it'
1300809319: <]3d0g> which I specifically asked you yesterday :-P
1300809340: <tinfoil> He did
1300809344: <tinfoil> I saw it
1300809347: * tinfoil ducks
1300809366: <dp> he did, I know

1300809419: <dp> ]3d0g: so can you not get back jobs that are in a different shell?
1300809457: <tinfoil> The issue is their STDIO is tied to a different TTY
1300809471: <tinfoil> If you can redirect that on the fly, you're golden
1300809477: <tinfoil> or you can run everything in "screen"
1300809494: <]3d0g> screen is your god dp.
1300809499: <dp> I know about screen. but I have stuff that I run in a startup script, that will occasionally crash
1300809510: <dp> guess I'm gonna have to do it that way
1300809529: <]3d0g> I'm not aware of a way to re-associate a process with a different TTY
1300809543: <tinfoil> There was ttysnoop
1300809552: <tinfoil> but does that even still work?
1300809863: <]3d0g> you know what would make this day just a teeny, tiny bit more tolerable?

1300810819: <]3d0g> we'll be needing vid of that.
1300810845: <hoamchan> make sure it's high frame rate so we can watch it in slomo

1300816629: <tinfoil> Compost won't admit my address exists and is making me jump through hoops to prove it
1300816646: <tinfoil> I got tired of it - Qwest stepped up
1300816699: <tinfoil> The funny thing is, my building was built 100 years ago, and is not only in Seattle metro, but in Downtown. 
1300816730: <tinfoil> I know people on either side of my apartmen tthat have compost
1300816735: <tinfoil> but they say my address doesn't exist
1300816947: <dp> compost?
1300816954: <dp> that doesn't sound like any DSL service I'd want
1300817438: <tinfoil> Compst isn't DSL
1300817441: <tinfoil> \it's Cable
1300817449: <tinfoil> They are also know as Comcast
1300817460: <dp> ah
1300817467: <tinfoil> You might have heard of them
1300817481: <tinfoil> Sadly bit for bit, compost is cheaper than dsl

1300979078: <acr0nym> Someday, I'm going to decide that it is, in fact, a better choice to scoop out one of my eyes with a grapefruit spoon than go to meetings with this Project Manager.
1300980619: <tinfoil> dp: yeah
1300980975: <dp> tinfoil: then why not just have nginx run php through an fcgi?
1300981120: <tinfoil> dp:  Every article that compares the two performance wise says why
1300981131: <dp> which is?
1300981166: <tinfoil> nginx as a caching proxy against apache appears to perform significantly faster than running the fcgi itself
1300981197: <tinfoil> because it can cash the output from the fcgi i presume
1300981324: <tinfoil> A neat side effect to my setup currently - the web hosting directory is mounted as "noexec".  the suexec fcgi wrapper script that runs the fcgi's sits in a folder that allows exec  :-)  
1300981344: <tinfoil> so someone compromises the server and drops an exec, it still can't run
1300982903: <tinfoil> Actually, I should make home nonexec too
1300982908: <tinfoil> noexec
1300982943: <tinfoil> anywhere non-root can drop an exec it won't run. :-)

1301582038: <AMDave> saw your post in the F'rums
1301582058: <AMDave> thought long time since I IRC'd
1301582062: <AMDave> felt sad about that
1301582092: * AMDave feels much better now :)
1301582096: <dp> yep, it has
1301582105: <dp> I'm hoping to get some more regulars in here
1301582134: <AMDave> I think I may be able to get some punters for you.
1301582152: <dp> cool
1301582156: <dp> the more the merrier
1301582163: <AMDave> I still know some bods that used to IRC and I'm heading their way with some conversational material
1301582170: <AMDave> might set up a room
1301582173: <AMDave>  will see
1301582177: <dp> by all means
1301582183: <dp> everyone is welcome
1301582210: <AMDave> heh...You are not a spider are you? j/k
1301582215: <dp> :D
1301582246: <AMDave> just dropped in through a few old IRC rooms on the way here
1301582258: <AMDave> it's gone badly quiet out there
1301582269: <dp> it has
1301582321: <AMDave> just wait til the voice network fails and all the TXTs and PXTs and TWITs go to null/void and they all go ... IRC??? never heard of it
1301582339: <AMDave> their asses will be less dumb than they are. ho ho ho
1301582353: * AMDave climbs back on chair
1301582487: <AMDave> so I have been working my butski off and filling in the blanks doing amd-users stuff, FDCPS and NPLB support and trying desperately to get back to doing some new stuff with Bok and Gopher.
1301582508: <AMDave> What has been filling in your day for you?
1301582706: <AMDave> question - have you connected to a server CLI via ssh from your mobile phone yet.
1301582723: <AMDave> I'm still looking for the right platform for that.
1301582772: <AMDave> Hate it when I get a call on the mobile and the lappy is not with me, but I know that I can use the mobile with the laptop to connect to the server
1301582802: <AMDave> Why can't we have an ssh client from the phone screen direct to the server.
1301582811: <AMDave> It's an OS isn't it?
1301582825: <AMDave> maybe I just have the wrong equipment.
1301582883: * AMDave pauses to end the soliloquy :P
1301582949: <AMDave> confirmed. http://primesearch.free-dc.org/stats/index.php is back in business.

1301583184: * AMDave sighs
1301583204: <AMDave> bought the wrong handset a year ago, didn't I
1301583250: <AMDave> just found - sadly - old articles saying that the SSH client don't work in this version.
1301583289: <AMDave> heh. I still got it. If style means "to suck".
1301583372: <AMDave> Unfortunate though because my handset is quite clever, robust and no-button attractive
1301583408: <AMDave> ahh. it was a brief steppingsone between point and point b
1301583417: <AMDave> I bought a dead end.
1301583420: <AMDave> LOL
1301583428: <AMDave> oh lordy
1301583470: * AMDave realises the soliloquy never does really end.
1301583508: * AMDave acknowledges that there are just too many heads in one thought for it not to be shared
1301583596: <AMDave> ooh. almost poetic.
1301583624: <AMDave> that'll be the late night beer BANGING away that it's time for bed.

1301929758: <]3d0g> Los Angeles, yes!
1301932031: <acr0nym> Why LA?
1301932236: <]3d0g> 3-day Enterprise Infrastructure Standards (read lots of arguing) meeting.
1301932242: <acr0nym> Heh, ah.  Fun!
1301932273: <]3d0g> Vogon poetry is a cakewalk in comparison, I can assure.
1301932305: <tinfoil> that's saying a lot
1301932327: <tinfoil> Personally having that in LA is the worse part
1301932347: <]3d0g> Well, it was El Segundo, TBH.

1301933383: <fbx> ]3d0g: did anyone reach a decision (besides what was for lunch each day)?
1301933526: <]3d0g> Oh, there's some interesting dynamics here fbx. TWC corp *thinks* they can make "standards" but each region is independent. They got quite a wake-up call when we told them these weren't standards but merely proposals. 
1301933551: <]3d0g> That said, some of the stuff they proposed was quite good and I'm on board with it. Other stuff, not so much. 
1301933552: <fbx> i'm with acr0nym: Fun!
1301933815: <]3d0g> oh, and lunch was catered :-p
1301933826: <fbx> lol
1301933853: <]3d0g> I blew off dinners with the lot too. Met up with some local homebrewers instead.
1301933926: <tinfoil> Sounds like the preferred plan
1301933999: <]3d0g> The upside was, I always get played as the non-standard rebel in the company. Was good to hear the other regions back up my gripes. Not sure I'll get invited to the next one :)
1301934361: <dp> we don't have comcast here, so I have to vote Best Buy
1301934813: <tinfoil> Oh, no wonder comcast doesn't know my address exists.  My neighborhood is under another carrier even though CC dominates the area
1301934857: <tinfoil> Alas, 15Mbps service for the same price as my 12Mbps DSL is hardly worth the switch
1301937023: <milkchan> i thought crazy gay island was sanfrancisco
1301937048: <]3d0g> the whole state really.
1301937057: <tinfoil> s/state/coast/
1301937060: <milkchan> nah. fucking california is mormon infested
1301937077: <]3d0g> Tho I prefer NoCal over SoCal any day.
1301937083: <milkchan> the religious nutters think that when they recover california's 55 electoral votes, jebus himself will arrive
1301937140: <milkchan> the fact that prop 8 happened in CA should show the force isn't as gay as you'd think
1301937242: <]3d0g> I did make a day-trip down to San Diego to visit Pizza Port brewing. Had not been that far South before. 
1301937279: <milkchan> oh i had a coffee porter from real ale
1301937289: <milkchan> fucking tasty but NASTY headaches ensued
1301937324: <]3d0g> I'm not a big fan of coffee in beer.
1301937332: <]3d0g> many like it thouhg
1301937362: <milkchan> furthest south i've been in CA is costa mesa
1301937366: <milkchan> anna's linnens and frys 
1301937385: <milkchan> one was client, the other shopping while @ client
1301937427: <]3d0g> Fry's is very wallet hostile to me. I successfully avoided this trip.
1301937443: <milkchan> heh
1301937453: <milkchan> the fry's -atlanta north sucked
1301937459: <dp> hrm... I've been to Irvine once... drove up and down PCH ogling not the women, but the cars
1301937468: <milkchan> nothing like the ones they have in CA
1301938271: <milkchan> ugh
1301938277: <milkchan> in a basement with no cell signal
1301938285: <milkchan> this place looks like a 1950's bomb shelter
1301938335: <dp> heh
1301938338: <dp> as well it should
1301938341: <dp> ls
1301938344: <dp> whoops
1301938368: <milkchan> at least i can ssh out
1301938384: <milkchan> udp is blocked
1301938406: <tinfoil> Thats why I usually run OpenVPN on UDP and TCP
1301938410: <tinfoil> UDP preferred
1301938434: <]3d0g> IPsec is much happier over UDP
1301938469: <milkchan> tunneling tcp over tcp works but you get really nasty issues when you're on a bad connection.  inside and outside tries to auto-tune and scale
1301938491: <milkchan> linode
1301938494: <]3d0g> plus the unnecessary ack overhead.
1301938503: <milkchan> linode's lish listens on 443 now too
1301938514: <dp> lish?
1301938535: <milkchan> limited shell.  it's their OOB method.  essentially a screen session to your console
1301938660: <tinfoil> That is such a brilliant idea

1301938759: <milkchan> you still at clearwire?
1301938760: <]3d0g> you having VPN issues tinfoil?
1301938768: <tinfoil> no
1301938793: <tinfoil> I always keep my openvpn server listening on UDP and TCP
1301938796: <tinfoil> that's all
1301938806: <tinfoil> if I don't have UDP egress, I have a TCP fallback
1301938814: <]3d0g> We do the same on our Cisco
1301938820: <tinfoil> Nice.  :-)
1301938859: <milkchan> i can't believe in this day and age they still don't do protocol enforcement on https proxies
1301938884: <milkchan> or firewalls in general
1301938975: <tinfoil> Bluecoat can, but you have to set it up as a MITM proxy
1301938981: <tinfoil> at least it could
1301939000: <tinfoil> MITM proxy means you have to load your CA cert onto every machine in the org
1301939374: <tinfoil> that reminds me, I wonder if someone still makes a proxy that works over HTTP requests
1301939379: <tinfoil> err
1301939380: <tinfoil> VPN
1301939392: <tinfoil> (ie, actual HTTP, not HTTPS-CONNECT)
1301939410: <tinfoil> I've been tempted to get every tunneling method I know working on my sago box again

1302020128: <acr0nym> Hrmm.  Apparently, I'm not a good watch geek.  I care less about tritium than having to set a watch.
1302020191: <]3d0g> Oh, I'm with ya. But I simply can't read mine anymore w/o staring at it for 10+ seconds. Not ideal while driving :)
1302020208: <acr0nym> Ah.  You think tritium will help?

1302533948: --> ]3d0g (jkarp@6988929A.F4AE6A51.BF63E968.IP) has joined #lobby
1302533948: <PipSqueek> ]3d0g: Prost!
1302534175: <milkchan> kinda cool google latitude hasn't been able to figure out where i work
1302534813: <]3d0g> can't figure out where I live either. last updated fucked it up real good.
1302535293: <dp> there doesn't seem to be a way to set that either
1302535298: <dp> least not from what I can see
1302535447: <]3d0g> You can set home and work addresses from https://www.google.com/latitude/b/0/history/dashboard
1302535447: <PipSqueek> http://goo.gl/nQh3c (Google Latitude)
1302535447: <]3d0g> not that it helps any
1302535462: <dp> oop, I can
1302535464: <dp> missed that
1302535473: <dp> 224,308 more miles to the Moon
1302535506: <]3d0g> When I'm @ home, latitude locates me in "Colorado". No further detail.
1302535563: <dp> lol
1302535604: <]3d0g> Which means I can't use the new home check-in feature.
1302535730: <TeleCon> 178945 more miles to the moon for me.
1302535761: <dp> TeleCon: unfortunately for me, the 3G iPhone didn't support background apps, so I didn't really even get to start tracking information till last week
1302535853: <TeleCon> Ah
1302535854: <dp> what's everyones drive to work (normally) look like?
1302535882: <TeleCon> 25 miles for me.
1302535904: <acr0nym> About 17 for me.
1302535922: <dp> one-way?
1302535929: <TeleCon> Yeah
1302535959: <acr0nym> Yeah.
1302535959: <]3d0g> 62 each way for me.
1302535963: <acr0nym> You said "to work"
1302535986: <dp> just verifying ;)
1302535994: <dp> ]3d0g: srsly? jebus
1302535998: <acr0nym> Google Maps says 17.6 miles.  :)
1302536053: <dp> 21 for me
1302536097: <TeleCon> 22.1 one way, 25.6 the other main route I take.
1302536104: <TeleCon> 40 minutes either way.
1302536197: <milkchan> 40,913 miles traveled according to latitude. 163,102 miles according to continental (actual lifetime eqms)
1302536238: <]3d0g> I blew away my history last week in an attempt to fix the bugs. No dashboard for me for another 2 weeks.
1302536272: <dp> doh
1302537412: <milkchan> CM 7 dropped today eh?
1302537414: <milkchan> release?
1302537427: <TeleCon> Yeah
1302537512: <TeleCon> And actually, yesterday. 
1302537573: <milkchan> i'm like a bank.  after a certain time, it posts next business day
1302537607: <milkchan> mikey on foursquare. we should all stalk him
1302537619: <milkchan> cos he's too cool for latitude
1302537989: <fbx> dp: drive is around 50 miles here
1302538056: <fbx> wildest guess is regular to/from work miles over the last 7.5 years is about 150k
1302538276: <milkchan> good thing i dont drive to the office every day
1302538277: <milkchan> 2,892 mi
1302538307: <fbx> google says i'm 56.5 miles
1302538339: <fbx> so 56.5x2x200x7.5 = 169500
1302538354: <fbx> math
1302538363: <milkchan> not fundamental.  that's reading
1302538370: <fbx> got it
1302538391: <fbx> PipSqueek: math 56.5*2*200*7.5
1302538391: <PipSqueek> fbx: 169500
1302538408: <fbx> missed the p<tab>
1302538544: <milkchan> ok so who we going to get to primary obarma
1302538830: <fbx> nobody of consequence is
1302538832: <fbx> or will
1302538918: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
1302539174: <milkchan> so pub light or batshit insane?
1302539185: <milkchan> there has to be a reasonable alternatie
1302539188: <milkchan> alternative
1302539966: <fbx> who's pub light? obama? unfortunately, i'd have to say so at this point.
1302539967: <fbx> or rather
1302539973: <fbx> his objective is compromise
1302539993: <fbx> so he starts out somewhere in the middle of the spectrum
1302540022: <fbx> the folks he negotiates with start out on the far right and he invariably has to come right to agree on anything
1302540029: <fbx> which makes him, by default, pub light
1302540054: <fbx> if he were more rooseveltian, he'd start out way on the left and come to the middle
1302540062: <fbx> i'd be happier with that
1302540157: <milkchan> he went in guns blazing
1302540185: <milkchan> somewhere along the line i think he got sat down and told how things go. ie: threatened
1302540333: <fbx> i just think he starts negotiations thinking things will be different, more mature and less political every time. disappointing that he's not the one being called an "adult" in all this.
1302540357: <fbx> that label has gone to paul "catfood" ryan
1302540475: <fbx> i mean seriously...the budget discussion starts out as "ok, we aren't raising taxes for anyone at all, and we're going to increase the military's budget, but we're gutting the social safety net so the weakest of our citizens will sink into abject poverty just staying alive"
1302540479: <fbx> really?
1302540482: <fbx> really?
1302540545: <fbx> even though taxes are lower now in relation to the gdp than ever in the country's history - at since we've had taxes on businesses and citizens?
1302540580: <fbx> and lower than they've been on those holding the top 5% of wealth or making the top 5% of salary in this nation's history?
1302540626: <fbx> because what...we're scared they'll invest elsewhere? let them. fuckers aren't doing anything but enriching themselves anyway. fuck em.
1302540640: <fbx>  /sopabox
1302540646: <fbx>  /soapbox too
1302540688: <tinfoil> "Remember when Planned Parenthood & NPR crashed the market, wiped out half our 401Ks and took TARP money? Me neither."
1302540697: <fbx> and no, they're not going to touch AMT either, right? who in this # does that fuck in the ass?
1302540707: <fbx> tinfoil: hear hear
1302541051: <milkchan> i dunno.  i think it's pretty simple. pay no us taxes, you're not a us company. you shouldn't be able to spend more in lobbying money than you in actual US tax dollars paid
1302541091: <milkchan> attempting to lobby > taxes paid = treason. corporate veil instantly pierced. go directly to jail
1302541108: <milkchan> you want undue influence?  pay the fuck up
1302541888: <TeleCon> attempting to lobby > taxes paid = treason. <- that's an interesting idea.
1302541926: <fbx> how would you quantify that, in light of citizens united?
1302541965: <TeleCon> Make it universal.
1302541980: <TeleCon> No single entity is allowed to spend more lobbying than was paid in taxes.
1302542021: <fbx> then you'd have to do away with secondary organizations like crossroads
1302542062: <tinfoil> So, can I keep my income taxes if I give up voting?  :-)
1302542067: * tinfoil ducks
1302542117: <TeleCon> Sounds good to me.
1302542128: <TeleCon> If voting could change anything, it would be against the law.
1302542875: <milkchan> i'd make it so you had to earn at least 50% of your taxable income (and pay it) in the US to be legal to lobby in the US.  lobby, fund commercials, pacs, etc
1302542887: <milkchan> otherwise you're not a us company
1302542895: <milkchan> don't wanna pay your taxes, you have no say in the process
1302542897: <milkchan> gtfo
1302543008: <milkchan> you want to account yourself out of the country, go right ahead
1302543349: <milkchan> i'd love to see a class action lawsuit against the govt. on behalf of every citizen, an equal protection complaint
1302544055: <fbx> i'd just settle for capital gains taxes being the same as wage taxes. however you earn it, it's taxed the same, period.
1302544077: <milkchan> that would fall under an equal protection complaint
1302544593: <TeleCon> But I pay capital gains taxes.
1302544604: <TeleCon> On profits made with money that was alreadyu taxed once.
1302544611: <TeleCon> So I should pay taxes again?
1302544668: <fbx> to each separate party that money becomes "income", it is taxable as such.
1302545404: <fbx> now, if you can make that stick within corporate taxation, i'd forever shut up about politics
1302545411: <fbx> ...and how likely is that?
1302545661: <dp> TeleCon: but the money you "earned" wasn't taxed yet
1302545796: <TeleCon> It was when the stock was purchased.
1302545816: <dp> no, I'm talking about your profit
1302546001: <TeleCon> The profit that the company made, which caused the stock to increase in value was.
1302546036: <fbx> classic loaf of bread argument
1302546087: <fbx> you been reading freerepublic or something?
1302546089: <fbx> ;)
1302546147: <TeleCon> no.
1302546159: <TeleCon> But this is part of why I find the fair tax so appealing.
1302546257: <fbx> the supposed 23% sales tax thing? c'mon TeleCon 
1302546278: <TeleCon> I'm pretty sure it would be better than the current system.
1302546293: <TeleCon> I don't know that I agree with the exact numbers though.
1302546359: <TeleCon> I do have to admit that a part of that is that I hate filing taxes.
1302546361: <fbx> do you realize that the 23% works out to around 30% when done as taxes are today on everything else we have taxed, right?
1302546363: <TeleCon> Probably even a large part.
1302546368: <fbx> no argument there
1302546387: <fbx> i'd love for my tax return to fit on a postcard
1302546403: <TeleCon> I'd rather not have to do anything, at all.
1302546403: <fbx> or a single sheet, for that matter
1302546456: <fbx> i'd rather not, however, have a consumption tax. especially THAT one.
1302546469: <fbx> in lieu of income taxes, taht is
1302546485: <TeleCon> I kind of like the idea.
1302546491: <TeleCon> Don't consume, don't pay tax.
1302546510: <fbx> so...on everything? no exclusions?
1302546514: <TeleCon> I think there would be shock waves throughout the economy though.
1302546532: <TeleCon> The current system does nothing to encourage thrift, or savings.
1302546539: --- acr0nym has changed the topic to: "Good-bye. I am leaving because I am bored." -- George Saunders
1302546557: <TeleCon> Certain types of food should be excluded.
1302546564: <TeleCon> So no, not everything.
1302546570: <TeleCon> Though everything would be simplest.
1302546572: <fbx> i think you'd price a lot of folks out of basic goods. that's one issue i have with the 'fair tax'
1302546591: <fbx> rent would then be taxed
1302546595: <TeleCon> The prebate doesn't cut it for that?
1302546603: <TeleCon> Nah, I don't think rent should be taxed.
1302546611: <fbx> gasoline would probably end up costing 75 cents to $1 more per ga
1302546649: <fbx> this is the problem...that scheme is trying to get to simple taxes, and i don't think it does
1302546650: <milkchan> by the time you figure out all your exclusions, your fair tax will be a hell of a lot more complicated than what you're seeking to replace
1302546659: <fbx> right
1302546684: <fbx> buying a house would be taxed if everything were....that would be HELL
1302546691: <milkchan> p&l is the simplest. corporations and people should be taxed on profits, not income
1302546744: <fbx> and in order to exclude anything and be revenue neutral to start with , you'd have to offset, or go back to living on the national credit as we are now
1302546752: <fbx> it's a headache
1302546768: <milkchan> well we already have allowed deductions
1302546773: <milkchan> on income
1302546812: <fbx> so have less
1302546843: <fbx> carry losses three years. period.
1302546864: <fbx> deduct for the first 5 kids, and make birth control available, ffs.
1302546893: <fbx> houses? mortgage interest and whatnot? i dunno
1302546918: <fbx> tax any income at the same graduated rates
1302546928: <fbx> five income tax levels period
1302546964: <milkchan> since i'm in a cell signal-less dungeon i figured i'd wipe the phone
1302547001: <milkchan> cm 7 on it. seems the google apps won't even show unless you activate and put in your google account
1302547003: <milkchan> no anonymous maps
1302547007: <milkchan> go figure
1302547022: <TeleCon> You have to install gapps add on to get them, too.
1302547040: <milkchan> did that
1302547049: <fbx> base them on standard deviations of poverty level, perhaps
1302547059: <fbx> we're at about a page now for most returns
1302547069: <milkchan> the apks are all on the fs
1302547086: <milkchan> but they won't even show because i haven't put in my gmail account info yet
1302547139: <TeleCon> See, I don't think that people should be forced to be accountants for the man once a year.
1302547153: <TeleCon> Make it simple, make it transparent, make it automatic.
1302547690: <fbx> i agree, TeleCon. the most i want to do before 4/15 each year is write (possibly) six figures on a piece of paper and send it on.

1302631458: <acr0nym> Dude, don't deny it, the idiotic tickets I get are worth sympathy regardless of how big a dick I am.

1302632285: <acr0nym> Heh.
1302632439: <milkchan> naked is kinda boring in a way
1302632451: <milkchan> nothing left to the imagination
1302632508: <tinfoil> :-)
1302632597: <]3d0g> that's quite the patent.
1302632625: <milkchan> waterpik is claiming prior art
1302632817: <tinfoil> Most clits don't like waterpicks - too sharp.  I can think of several porn sites that used something similar to this, however.
1302633124: <milkchan> you consume much more interesting pr0n than i do apparantly
1302633638: <milkchan> anyone else try the cm 7 yet?

1302649944: <tinfoil> Oh, this is a brilliant idea... make all the documentation for a product you sell web based on your support site.  Not downloadable
1302649962: <tinfoil> that way there if someone's support contract goes out, they better have their own documentation, or pay up
1302649985: <tinfoil> In our budget suspension a lot of products came up on their one year license in the last month
1302649995: <tinfoil> we can't renew, so the suport contracts lapse
1302650002: <tinfoil> One of them has that precise system
1302650014: <tinfoil> so now we have a problem, we can't even look at the documentation to help ourselves.  :-)

1302713327: <acr0nym> Didn't actually do the damage.
1302713459: <milkchan> anything more than 15k for a brand new car is just pure "i have a small penis"

1302713516: <fbx> heh...we spent almost 18k on a slightly used replacement for the wife

1302713555: <fbx> she got a crossover type
1302713558: <milkchan> and i mean just a "commuter" type vehicle. not saying there isn't cause for big ass family mobiles or trucks

1302713766: <fbx> suburus are supposedly pretty good cars all around. yes?
1302713849: <milkchan> i abused mine mercilessly for 10 years, put 140k miles on it, didn't maintain it properly, and parked it for 8 months without moving. after a jumpstart, i was able to drive it to the fire dept with police escort as it was unregistered by then
1302713864: <milkchan> subarus are great cars. subaru dealers are fucking thieves though

1302713930: <]3d0g> My tacoma was an insanely pleasant purchase experience.
1302713952: <milkchan> the scion was pleasant too.  i got ripped off but no more than anyone else would with fixed pricing
1302713978: <fbx> ]3d0g: toyota dealer was just happy to see ANYONE ;)
1302713981: <milkchan> was it just a good dealer or something more corporate, 3dog
1302714038: <]3d0g> I walked in just before Christmas and said "This is what i want. This is what I'll pay. I've got my own financing lined up. If you've got it on the lot, pull it up here and I'll sign. 
1302714048: <milkchan> pff.  if domestic brands suffered the same scrutiny that toyota did, they'd be bankrupt by now... er
1302714049: <]3d0g> I was out of the dealer in under an hour.
1302714066: <fbx> ]3d0g: my buddy who has a tacoma was only irritated at his dealer when the dealer asked - numerous times - if he wanted 4x4 drive, which he didn't.
1302714066: <dp> milkchan: he likes his
1302714087: <]3d0g> see, I did. and manual tranny. 
1302714116: <]3d0g> timing was a big part of it fbx. There was NOBODY in that dealership except me that evening.
1302714130: <fbx> see? happy to see ANYBODY
1302714131: <fbx> ;)
1302714149: <milkchan> so 500 over cost is cheaper than having a big ass truck sitting on the lot for another X days?
1302714184: <fbx> prolly
1302714196: <]3d0g> sure, plus getting it off their books for year-end inventory.
1302714207: <fbx> plus, book another sale. in december, even.

1302714250: <]3d0g> I just liked that there was zero "let me run these numbers past my manager" bullshit. He said OK, I said OK and the deal was done in 60 seconds.
1302714251: <tinfoil> dp:  What happened to the BMW?
1302714271: <dp> tinfoil: heh. that was two cars ago; but we got rid of it because of the payment
1302714277: <fbx> dp: biofuel? SVO? or are you a dick and just get straight diesel? ;)
1302714285: <dp> 4 and a half bills a month is a bit much for a car
1302714291: <dp> fbx: currently, straight diesel
1302714292: <]3d0g> Are the TDIs the maintenance nightmares I hear of?
1302714313: <dp> not that I've seen thus far. though they might be better maintained around here

1302717082: <dp> milkchan: "no one can unless you're law enforcement or making night cash deposits" huh?
1302717194: <milkchan> it's exceedingly difficult to get a valid nj weapons carry permit

1302717239: <milkchan> i can buy and own, but it has to be fully dismantled in a certain way for transport
1302717258: <milkchan> need to break it down and reassemble just going to and from a range
1302717294: <fbx> and my guess is taking the clip out isn't dismantled enough?
1302717450: <milkchan> i don't know the full regs only that it's so much of a pain in the ass as to not really want to bother
1302717470: <milkchan> less paper work filling out the insurance after you've been robbed
1302717479: <milkchan> or the police report after the mugging
1302717505: <milkchan> self defense is a much more heinous crime in new jersey than murder
1302717556: <milkchan> which is why the democrats are perpetually snatching defeat from the jaws of victory around here
1302717615: <milkchan> they air commercials touting how new jersey spends more money on insurance fraud investigation and prosecution than any other state in the nation. really. that's why my rates are the highest in the country

1302807818: <acr0nym> Heh.
1302807857: <acr0nym> Transcendent Man is a documentary film by filmmaker Barry Ptolemy. The film chronicles the life and ideas of Ray Kurzweil, inventor, futurist, and author of The Singularity is Near. Transcendent Man presents his vision of technological singularity, the point in the future in which technology will be advancing so rapidly that humans will have to enhance themselves with artificial intelligence in order to keep up. Kurzweil predicts the dawning of a new civili

1302808874: <acr0nym> Many of the most recognized writers on the singularity, such as Vernor Vinge and Ray Kurzweil, define the concept in terms of the technological creation of superintelligence, and allege that a post-singularity world would be unpredictable to humans due to an inability of human beings to imagine the intentions or capabilities of superintelligent entities.

1302893523: <tinfoil> So in out budget crunch, they let a whole bunch of annual licenses lapse recently
1302893528: <tinfoil> including our redhat license
1302893535: <tinfoil> so we can't update any of our boxes
1302893544: <tinfoil> meanwhile, they're not meeting security complaince requirements
1302893579: <tinfoil> I was told to convert my centos server to redhat, so I did and not I can't update
1302893624: <tinfoil> to compound that I can't install any of the tools I need from the repository directly and have no dev tools installed.
1302893742: <tinfoil> So I can't do my job
1302893756: <tinfoil> I could manually install them, but that means also determining the dependencies of the packages
1302893768: <tinfoil> What a PITA
1302893777: <tinfoil> I shouldn't have to jump through these hoops to do my job
1302900578: <tinfoil> So I created a ticket that I can't install packages on that server - said it's a high priority because it's blocking me from doing my job (which is true)
1302900582: <tinfoil> IT closed it
1302900610: <tinfoil> "We do not currently have space licenses.  We will rectify the this as soon as possible."
1302900625: <tinfoil> No - you keep the ticket open until the task is complete

1303211719: <dp> mostly, because it's the default :P
1303211727: <alpha> fair enough :)
1303219594: <milkchan> heh. the vmware applet crashed
1303219611: <milkchan> never had that happen before but then again, i've never really used it before
1303223076: --> ]3d0g (jkarp@6988929A.F4AE6A51.BF63E968.IP) has joined #lobby
1303223076: <PipSqueek> ]3d0g: Prost!
1303223926: <dp> ok, that's some shady web shit right there
1303223937: <dp> http://www.dp.cx/griffigr.html
1303223937: <PipSqueek> http://goo.gl/BLmF3 ()
1303224167: <]3d0g> easy. shut off javascript :)
1303224861: <dp> still shady
1303225136: <]3d0g> yeah, that new-fangled javascript stuff...
1303226266: <dp> I'm looking for a phrase, that's "like" 'special compensation', but means that I had to make modifications that were particular to some object
1303226312: <dp> compensation just doesn't seem like the right word
1303227033: <]3d0g> acr0nym - you got a pulse?
1303227037: <acr0nym> Nah.
1303227041: <]3d0g> bummer
1303227048: <acr0nym> Heh, 'sup?
1303227071: <]3d0g> got an older google search appliance. know anyone that wants to give it a good home?
1303227087: <acr0nym> I'm sure Denhac would take it.
1303227189: <]3d0g> I'll set it aside
1303227199: <acr0nym> Bring that IPA you've got for me, and my badge stuff tomorrow, and I'll work to make it by your office on the way home by about 15:30, and I'll pick it all up....
1303227202: <acr0nym> ;)
1303227215: <]3d0g> sounds good
1303227278: <acr0nym> I wanna get off campus early, tomorrow, anyway...  ;)
1303227286: <acr0nym> (Points for anyone who figgers out _why_)
1303227292: <]3d0g> 4/20~
1303227293: <]3d0g> !
1303227324: <]3d0g> vids from last year were hilarious
1303227521: <acr0nym> Well done!
1303227522: <acr0nym> Heh.
1303227528: <acr0nym> +1 Internets to YOU!
1303227541: <]3d0g> put it over there in the corner with the others 
1303227602: <acr0nym> You can totally build a pillow-fort with your Internets.
1303227615: <acr0nym> What's IN a Google Search Appliance, anyway?
1303227618: <]3d0g> or a 4chan party van!
1303227681: <]3d0g> never looked that close - simple pc, I'd imagine. it's basically a hardware indexer you point at any data you want indexed and searchable.
1303227693: <dp> yep
1303227699: <acr0nym> Gotcha.
1303227701: <dp> we had a couple of demo units at my last job
1303227706: <acr0nym> Yeah, I'm sure it'll get repurposed.
1303227715: <dp> it's all web interface. IIRC, it *only* has a network port, and an RS232
1303227723: <]3d0g> yup
1303228839: <dp> god *dammit* I hate forgetting why I opened my browser
1303228901: <acr0nym> Pr0n.  Or facebook.  Always the answer.
1303228932: <dp> neither
1303229041: <]3d0g> 4chan.org/b/ ?
1303229188: <dp> fuck. the kitten is back
1303229478: <]3d0g> that bad?
1303229493: <dp> it's less than 3 weeks old
1303229499: <dp> and is constantly crying
1303229517: <]3d0g> where's mama?
1303229583: <dp> no idea, sadly. this one was found in the parking lot
1303229666: <]3d0g> call animal control?
1303229672: <]3d0g> or a no-kill shelter?
1303229795: <dp> I think one of the girls at work is gonna take her home

1303235691: <fbx> 75 <A with hat>...
1303235704: <dp> that's a stretch
1303235714: <fbx> ?
1303235717: <fbx> you don't see it?
1303235723: <dp> sadly, no
1303235725: <fbx> hrm
1303235726: <dp> screenshot it
1303235727: <tinfoil> With a hat?
1303235752: <tinfoil> Just don't say you use putty
1303235754: <dp> I get the feeling he has some funky font
1303235773: <fbx> i use putty
1303235774: <tinfoil> bad font or bad terminal emulation
1303235778: <dp> tinfoil: he does; because for 99.99999999999999% of the people, it works *perfectly*
1303235789: <fbx> kiss my butt
1303235826: <tinfoil> Man, I'm loving minimal cygwin+mintty for shit like that. :-)
1303235837: <dp> "minimal"?
1303235840: <]3d0g> I see the degree symbol.
1303235847: <tinfoil> Basic shell, ssh client
1303235852: <tinfoil> and mintty
1303235853: <dp> tell me how much you had to download to get your "minimal" setup
1303235871: <tinfoil> dp:  It was a pain in the ass, but it's a lot bigger than putty
1303235878: <dp> right
1303235880: <tinfoil> better emulation, faster, less cpu overhead
1303235889: <tinfoil> and a real local shell
1303235897: <dp> you're talking about the difference between 5% cpu vs 1% cpu
1303235900: <tinfoil> almost like using linux with a crappy WM
1303235914: <tinfoil> Depends on how much data you're tunneling through it
1303235933: <fbx> won't go away, even using terminal font
1303235934: <dp> most people are just using it for shell, not tunneling
1303235957: <fbx> or fixedsys
1303235976: <dp> like I said; because for 99.99999999999999% of the people, it works *perfectly*
1303235978: <tinfoil> dp:  you know I'm just pushing your buttons, right?
1303235996: <dp> yep ;)
1303235999: <fbx> it's capital A with a caret, followed by the degree symbol
1303236009: <dp> I just like to argue
1303236014: <dp> fbx: screenshot it. 
1303236042: <tinfoil> disconnecting from the network, bbl
1303236275: <fbx> dp: where you want the screenshot
1303236276: <fbx> ?
1303236351: <dp> imgur.com will work
1303236381: <dp> or min.us
1303236503: <fbx> http://i.imgur.com/zb8ZP.jpg
1303236503: <PipSqueek> http://i.imgur.com/zb8ZP.jpg -- 
1303236509: <dp> interesting
1303236522: <fbx> that was the third font i used, all the same
1303236533: <dp> must be a bug somewhere
1303236565: <fbx> sure sure
1303236575: <fbx> in my head, mabye?
1303236578: <fbx> maybe*
1303236587: <dp> ;)
1303236599: <fbx> got that file rename thing working well now
1303236608: <fbx> thanks for the help
