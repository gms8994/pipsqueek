1271361729: <TeleCon> Of course, EU is closed because of the Volcanic activity in Icleand.
1271361740: <TeleCon> They've spent 2 days goofing around at DIA>
1271361747: <]3d0g> Fuck, I'd go to Paris in a goddamnend heartbeat. 
1271361827: <tinfoil> TeleCon: Are those guys something like incident response or some sort of emergency response?
1271361840: <TeleCon> nope
1271361843: <TeleCon> Dev team.
1271361851: <tinfoil> Short of that, I can't find an acceptable reason to tell someone to travel in less than a week's notice
1271361867: <TeleCon> Hell, for sec incident response, it would be me.
1271361875: <acr0nym> a company recently acquired by europeans....  Heh.
1271361880: <tinfoil> And for the record, I hate it when people put multi-line data into an excel spreadsheet
1271361891: <TeleCon> I guess that means I should consider getting a passport.
1271361899: <tinfoil> makes parsing CSV/tab on the command line nearly impossible
1271361919: <acr0nym> TeleCon: Yeah, like, today....  It's taking an unreasonable time to get a passport lately.
1271361948: <tinfoil> TeleCon: Wait until you need to travel, then get an expidited passport at the expense of your company
1271361964: <ouiji> heh
1271361968: <acr0nym> Heh, except that expedited still means a month.
1271361972: <ouiji> ya gotta love ADD
1271362001: <acr0nym> http://travel.state.gov/passport/get/processing/processing_1740.html
1271362004: <tinfoil> Solution A) Management says get the passport, you order it and wait (not your problem)
1271362021: <tinfoil> Solution B) Management tells you to travel, you order it expedited, and wait (not your problem)
1271362054: <tinfoil> Solution C) You take inititive, it's your fault.  :-)
1271362068: <TeleCon> I picked up the paperwork earlier today when I was getting bent over a chair by the irs.
1271362078: <tinfoil> How much do you owe?
1271362089: <TeleCon> Wrote the check for 744
1271362093: <tinfoil> Oh
1271362097: <TeleCon> plus 250 to state.
1271362103: <tinfoil> ~$8000
1271362108: <TeleCon> ouch
1271362111: <acr0nym> Dude, that wasn't bent over a chair....  That was like a gentle prostate massage....
1271362124: <acr0nym> Yeah, combined, I'm about 5500.
1271362128: <]3d0g> how the hell do you owe in CO? 
1271362135: <]3d0g> It's a flat %
1271362155: <acr0nym> Yeah, if the whiff and I both think about it, when she goes back to work....
1271362156: <tinfoil> ]3d0g: 1099 work?
1271362164: <TeleCon> Having too many exemptions while at level 3.
1271362172: <]3d0g> I owed $700 fed but got back $1200 state. Nothing I can do to reduce state.
1271362187: <acr0nym> And, I had some 1099 work.  Heh.
1271362187: <]3d0g> CO doesn't use exemptions
1271362191: <TeleCon> I had lots of dental expenses, or it would have been a lot more.
1271362205: <tinfoil> At least I live in a state without income tax now :-)
1271362209: <TeleCon> ]3d0g: Apparantly not enough was withheld.
1271362220: <tinfoil> I remember living in NYC - I owed Fed, State, AND City tax
1271362222: <]3d0g> that's VERY weird.
1271362240: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: I'm pretty sure he meant withholdings.
1271362241: <tinfoil> 35% of every check went to taxes
1271362258: <acr0nym> Or, allowances.
1271362268: <acr0nym> Oh, yeah, withholding allowances.  Heh.
1271362279: <]3d0g> right, but CO withholding is a flat %. CO does not use allowances
1271362301: <TeleCon> I don't get it then.
1271362307: <acr0nym> Oh, you're asking about state payment.
1271362309: <TeleCon> I should have gotten co back, I would think.
1271362318: <TeleCon> Then
1271362319: <]3d0g> I agree
1271362325: <TeleCon> wtf
1271362338: <]3d0g> you got your 1040?
1271362344: <acr0nym> Oh, then for me, it's prolly the 1099, and the bracket change from the whiff makin' moneyz.
1271362357: <TeleCon> With me?  No
1271362375: <TeleCon> of course, combined we came very close to 150k.
1271362377: <TeleCon> Could be that.
1271362406: <]3d0g> Once you've got a copy of the 1040, just go to https://www.netfile.state.co.us/file2009/Welcome.jsp2 and fill it out. 
1271362429: <]3d0g> yeah 1099 and other income might change things.
1271362459: <TeleCon> Fuck.
1271362460: <dp> ugh
1271362464: <acr0nym> Umm, does that site actually file?
1271362465: <TeleCon> And I paid turbotax for that shit?
1271362467: <dp> we actually got back almost 1600 this year
1271362478: <dp> tinfoil: netflix code!
1271362488: <]3d0g> I've got 11 exemptions and usually come out even on Federal. Pisses me off I can't reduce state withholding.
1271362515: <]3d0g> yeah, NEVER pay for CO filing. It literally takes seconds to fill out that online thing.
1271362529: <]3d0g> It just asks for numbers from the 1040.
1271362572: <TeleCon> TT still says I owe money, too
1271362643: <TeleCon> tax owed $5,568
1271362650: <TeleCon> tax w/h $5,324
1271362657: <]3d0g> TT sucked this year. We refied our 1st and it refused to allow us to write off the points.
1271362798: <TeleCon> nice
1271362823: <TeleCon> Well, l3 took less state tax out of my overall income than the feds did out of Christi's income.
1271362829: <]3d0g> In fact, I'm wondering if it's not fucking with people. It kept nagging me to "upgrade" from basic to deluxe to save "even more" money. Call my cynical, but I'm thinking they're holding back eligible deductions in the base and free online versions.
1271362831: <TeleCon> So maybe l3 hosed it.
1271362850: <dp> really? wtf: www.reddit.com/tb/br9vj
1271362878: <]3d0g> no major corporation pays taxes. you didn't know this?
1271362899: <dp> I did not
1271362910: <dp> By contrast, the nation's largest corporation, Wal-Mart, paid $7.1 billion globally in taxes, and the lion's share of it—$5.9 billion, or 83 percent—went to the US government.
1271362967: <TeleCon> So I guess level 3 didn't withhold properly.
1271362969: <TeleCon> Dunno
1271363133: <dp> flat tax.  would be so much easier
1271363144: <dp> 20% on all income
1271363150: <dp> personal or corporate
1271363151: <]3d0g> http://www.forbes.com/2010/04/01/ge-exxon-walmart-business-washington-corporate-taxes_print.html

1271363609: <TeleCon> dp: I still like the fairtax.org concept, ven thoiught I bet numbers would have to be adjusted.
1271363767: <dp> TeleCon: interesting.  I'd not seen that before
1271363982: <TeleCon> I like the concept because it encourages saving and re-use
1271364015: <dp> agreed
1271364045: <dp> I also like the idea that the compliance oversight would be several factors of 10 smaller
1271364118: <TeleCon> Yeah, that is also a big economic gain. Combine that with drug legalization, and taxation.
1271364132: <TeleCon> The country would be a world better off.
1271364162: <TeleCon> Of course all those dea agents and irs agents might need some re-education to fit into productive jobs.
1271364437: <dp> hrm... I need to write my congressman a letter
1271365905: <dp> seen opencongress.org?

1271437140: <acr0nym> In a meeting.
1271437140: <acr0nym> Heh.
1271437146: <acr0nym> half attention.  At bes.
1271437149: <acr0nym> best, even.
1271437214: <tinfoil> Oh, does that mean I should start posting URL's here?
1271437232: <acr0nym> Sure.
1271437241: <acr0nym> If you want my machine to have an archive of them.
1271437248: <acr0nym> And, they're less than, umm, 100KB, I think.
1271437536: <dp> actually, what we should have is a log of the links
1271437540: <dp> I wonder if the bot can do that
1271437965: <acr0nym> Prolly.  I have a script that does it.

1271438578: <dp> just tried to sign up for an account somewhere

1271439861: <tinfoil> Anyone know a good took that will take XML and XSL and produce HTML with it?
1271439870: <tinfoil> Aside from most web browsers
1271439917: <fbx> the only Tooks I know lived in Hobbiton and took good beer and produced piss from it
1271440100: <dp> lol
1271440130: <dp> tinfoil: xsltproc
1271440518: <]3d0g> the most convoluted tool on the planet.
1271440535: <]3d0g> I DREAD every time I have to deal with xsltproc. 
1271440561: <fbx> converting XML to HTML isn't the most straightforward thing ever either, no?
1271440604: <]3d0g> my brain just doesn't like XSLT rules
1271440621: <fbx> what's with the closed bracket in your nick?
1271440652: <]3d0g> IRC doesn't allow numeric starts. ] is an AppleDOS thing.
1271440675: <fbx> Apple ][ !
1271440718: <fbx> guess i hadn't noticed that about irc
1271440720: <fbx> weird
1271440726: <fbx> been using it for years
1271440745: <dp> ]3d0g: it may be convoluted, but it works ;)
1271440755: <fbx> woulda thought i'd re-nick'd myself with a starting number at some point
1271440778: <]3d0g> well, *3dog would be more accurate but * isn't allowed either :-P
1271440801: <dp> System Uptime: 29 days 20 hours 45 minutes 35 seconds

1271440820: <fbx> ( * )( * ) isn't a valid name either
1271440824: <fbx> apparently
1271440876: <fbx> it appears much of the ascii set is barred as a first character
1271441880: <]3d0g> It is.
1271441902: <]3d0g> Has been since the early days of IRC. Dunno why.
1271442447: <fbx> no big, i just can't be named bigboobs ( ( * )( * ) )
1271442920: <dp> it's part of the RFC, IIRC
1271443512: <tinfoil> converted a RHEL5 machine to a centos5.4 machine
1271443513: <tinfoil> nice
1271443533: <fbx> big pain? no pain? in between?
1271443540: <tinfoil> so far, no pain
1271443553: <fbx> isn't SElinux centos with more security?
1271443579: <tinfoil> centos's goal is to be binary compatable with RHEL
1271443623: <TeleCon> tinfoil: Isn't that just a matter of changing repositories?
1271443636: <TeleCon> Though, in Rhells case, it should be called suppositories.
1271443637: <tinfoil> TeleCon: Essencially, it took about 12 commands
1271443656: <]3d0g> SElinux has nothing to do with a specific distro.
1271443697: <tinfoil> I was told to convert one of our servers to a desktop system running gnome over vnc
1271443727: <tinfoil> So our auditing manager can scan with t
1271443728: <tinfoil> it
1271443734: <tinfoil> because he doesnt like command line tools
1271443739: <tinfoil> *twitch*
1271443743: <fbx> ]3d0g: i thought the original SElinux was dev'd on centos...but now i think it was on redhat
1271443758: <fbx> hahahaha
1271443775: <fbx> tinfoil: what kinda auditing manager? IT auditing?
1271443776: <TeleCon> tinfoil: If he can't commandline scan, he shouldn't be doing it.
1271443779: <tinfoil> but anyway, it wasn't a registered RH machine, and was tied to the hosting company's repo which didn't carry desktop apps
1271443789: <fbx> TeleCon: i agree
1271443793: <]3d0g> No, SElinux was developed by the NSA.
1271443797: <tinfoil> TeleCon: He's my manager, and he's a dick, so I do what he asks
1271443802: <fbx> right
1271443802: <fbx> but
1271443813: <fbx> on RH, no?
1271443821: <tinfoil> It's kernel based
1271443823: <tinfoil> RH uses it
1271443826: <tinfoil> Centos
1271443828: <tinfoil> and others
1271443835: <fbx> as the original basis, then add the LSMs
1271443869: <]3d0g> There are many distros that use it - esp if they want govt. contract.s
1271443895: <fbx> so the LSMs were developed by DoD, then each distro added support?
1271443903: <]3d0g> yes
1271443904: <fbx> got it
1271443907: <fbx> duh
1271443929: <fbx> really...i'm not as stupid as you think i am
1271443941: <]3d0g> NSA Open Sourced their work.
1271443971: <fbx> i think the first distro i tried SElinux on was centos, hence my duh
1271443990: <fbx> "sure...include that in the install" "wtf? oops"
1271444006: <tinfoil> Centos directly derived from the same version redhat
1271444016: <tinfoil> without the bullshit
1271444036: <fbx> centos, fedora....
1271444043: <]3d0g> Even today, SE is a royal PITA. Don't bother unless you really need it.
1271444044: <fbx> several others..
1271444047: <tinfoil> Fedora isn't derived from redhat
1271444064: <tinfoil> think of fedora as the opensource development community for redhat
1271444066: <fbx> not directly
1271444078: <fbx> heh
1271444079: <tinfoil> so fedora work makes it way into redhat
1271444080: <tinfoil> not the other way
1271444083: <fbx> i think of it as "free redhat"
1271444083: <TeleCon> I <3 Ubuntu
1271444084: <TeleCon> ...
1271444098: <tinfoil> I don't mind ubuntu
1271444101: <tinfoil> it works
1271444101: <TeleCon> rHELL tends to make me crabby.
1271444115: * ]3d0g loves it (obvious bias)
1271444145: <TeleCon> I just don't think you know any better.
1271444149: <tinfoil> I still think I have an easier time running gentoo servers over anything else, but they are all acceptable as long as I have a competent staff
1271444165: <fbx> that's what she said
1271444183: * TeleCon rolls eyes
1271444194: <fbx> sounded better in my head
1271444207: <TeleCon> The whole competent staff thing.
1271444208: <TeleCon> Sure
1271444213: <fbx> nah
1271444215: <fbx> it was bad
1271444217: <fbx> sorry
1271444218: <]3d0g> Nobody's touching what RH is doing in enterprise linux space. Over 30 VMs running right now on my production cluster. fucking flawless...
1271444221: <fbx> need more sleep
1271444252: <]3d0g> Got Win 7, Vista, 2003, RH, Ubuntu and more, all humming along. 
1271444266: <tinfoil> what's that have to do with RHEL?
1271444270: <TeleCon> Which VM?
1271444271: <tinfoil> I have that now with vmware esx
1271444286: <TeleCon> Which hypervisor, I guess would be a better question.
1271444294: <]3d0g> yes, vmware is vm for pussies.
1271444303: <]3d0g> QEMU/KVM
1271444316: <TeleCon> Eucalyptus?
1271444327: <fbx> i bet it helps to have VT cpus
1271444385: <fbx> ]3d0g: vmware is vm for PHBs that want a support contract
1271444398: <fbx> and swag
1271444418: <fbx> and vmotion
1271444422: <]3d0g> we've got a company-wide agreement with vmware. RH support blows 'em away.
1271444461: <]3d0g> In fact, vmware probably would've been shown the door if RH had their gui manager out sooner.
1271444714: <TeleCon> What's the RH framework for all that stuff?
1271447098: <]3d0g> framework? for clustering?
1271447210: <TeleCon> the gui?
1271447849: <]3d0g> Oh, RHEVM. It's actually a 3rd party tool they bought. Runs on Windows, ironically. 
1271447873: <]3d0g> I don't use it though.
1271447917: <TeleCon> I wouldn't expect you ro.
1271447918: <TeleCon> to
1271447977: <fbx> runs on windows? wtf?
1271447978: <]3d0g> There's really only a handful of commands needed to manage a RH cluster. GUI just seems like such overkill to me.
1271447987: <fbx> as in, ONLY runs on windows?
1271448003: <]3d0g> yeah. They bought it and are working on porting. 
1271448025: <]3d0g> http://www.redhat.com/f/pdf/rhev/RHEV-S.pdf
1271448026: <fbx> wow...that just sounds...ridiculous. but not entirely unexpected.
1271448149: <fbx> how's live migration stack up against vmotion
1271448150: <fbx> ?
1271448284: <]3d0g> that's one of the better demos I do here for folk. create a windows VM (1-2 minutes), start VM, go to youtube and fire up a lady gaga vid and then live migrate it across nodes. not even a video frame drop.
1271448306: <fbx> pretty nice
1271448315: <fbx> although
1271448327: <fbx> could you tell if a lady gaga video dropped a frame? ;)
1271448335: <]3d0g> hey HEY
1271448341: <fbx> those things are dali-esque
1271448342: <]3d0g> don't harsh my girl.
1271448362: <fbx> i'm not...they're not boring, but they are a bit odd
1271448386: <fbx> especially WHEN YOUR SEVEN YEAR OLD SAYS "HEY DAD...HAVE YOU SEEN THIS SONG ON YOUTUBE?!?!?"
1271448390: <fbx> ahem
1271448396: <]3d0g> heh
1271448408: <]3d0g> Hope it wasn't the un-edited version of Telephone...
1271448417: <fbx> "we were just listening to the music...but the video is kinda strange...wanna see?"

1271449028: <dp> blargh
1271450175: <dp> 60 minutes
1271451142: <-- ouiji has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
1271451970: <dp> hrm
1271451980: <dp> can someone check my math?
1271452015: <dp> Earths Distance from the sun is 152097701 km from the sun
1271452027: <dp> and it's orbit is 1.0000175 years
1271452070: <dp> ignoring that we know that the orbit is elliptical, and we calculate the circular orbit distance, we get a number like 2.8 x 10^16
1271452100: <dp> which, given the amount of time it takes to orbit, implies that we're floating around the fireball at 3 Trillion miles per hour
1271452104: <dp> does that work out?
1271452230: <tinfoil> Well, I officially have Gnome running on a server
1271452239: <tinfoil> I need to take a shower now, after sending dp his link
1271452245: <dp> did you send it? :)
1271452304: <]3d0g> The Earth travels at roughly 67000 miles per hour.
1271452353: <]3d0g> err, that may be km/h. I don't remember 
1271452384: <dp> I believe my numbers are wrong
1271452390: <dp> I'm just trying to understand *why*
1271452412: <dp> the orbit time in hours for earth is ~8766
1271452417: <]3d0g> yeah, km/h. wiki's got it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation
1271452421: <]3d0g> including the maths
1271452462: <tinfoil> ]3d0g: If you're confused about what units a number is in, it sounds like you have a future career at nasa
1271452487: <]3d0g> always wanted to work for JPL. Can't stand Alabama though.
1271452503: <dp> ]3d0g: that explains rotation.  not orbit
1271452542: <dp> 108km/h
1271452544: <dp> er
1271452548: <dp> 108k km/h
1271452575: <dp> though
1271452580: <dp> they don't show *how* they got that number
1271452752: <dp> duh
1271452755: <dp> I'm an idiot
1271452765: <dp> pi*r^2 is circular area
1271452779: <dp> 2pi*r is circumference
1271452834: <]3d0g> pi r round dummy. cornbread are square.
1271452841: <dp> hehe
1271452861: <dp> interesting.  pluto is faster on a circular orbit than neptune is
1271452897: <]3d0g> then again, it's not a planet :)
1271453022: <dp> YES IT IS!
1271453028: <acr0nym> Heh.
1271453028: <dp> :P
1271453041: <dp> fbx: I need you to email me your addy

1271453058: <acr0nym> Or....
1271453061: <acr0nym> http://www.acr0nym.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_itemId=1960
1271453064: <acr0nym> Probably more pleasant.
1271453089: <dp> OH NOES!!!1 INSECURE!!!1
1271453272: <acr0nym> Heh, which one?  Did you get a big "unrecognized cert"?
1271453282: <acr0nym> If you did, you should get the root cert from cacert.org
1271453286: <acr0nym> because, they're cool.  And free.
1271453606: <TeleCon> I did get that, didn't care.
1271453623: <acr0nym> Heh.
1271453643: <TeleCon> I wish there was an easy way to move gmail between google accounts
1271453751: <TeleCon> So I could take gigabytes of medioh crap, and shove it into the medioh google apps for domains account.
1271453754: <TeleCon> muahahahah
1271453812: <]3d0g> I just have my apps account forward to my personal gmail.
1271453825: <TeleCon> yeah, but it's a company account.
1271453831: <]3d0g> oh
1271453836: <TeleCon> So I'd like to get that crap out of my personal inbox.
1271453881: <]3d0g> I just wish goog apps used the same damn code. annoying that it doesn't have the same feature set as "regular" gmail.
1271453924: <TeleCon> yeah
1271454163: <acr0nym> I quote Tenacious D, who said, "Have you ever been worked on by two guys who are hot for your snatch?"
1271454319: * ]3d0g retorts with a Gaga quote: "Once you kill a cow, you gotta make a burger."
1271454414: <acr0nym> Okay, here's one....  "I love you baby, but all I can think about is kielbasa sausage, your butt cheeks is warm"
1271454464: <TeleCon> um
1271454465: <TeleCon> k
1271454548: <acr0nym> How 'bout, "this is our song of exaltant joy, because we only came to kick some ass!"

1271689395: <]3d0g> meh
1271689412: <TeleCon> meh indeed
1271690409: <dp> fekkity
1271690816: <dp> silc.dp.cx is officially offline
1271691176: <acr0nym> Why fekkity?
1271691286: <]3d0g> some asshole fired another monday up.
1271691349: <dp> that too
1271691365: <dp> and AdWords charged the wrong fucking credit card
1271691383: <dp> and since PNC is a bunch of cockgobblers, they wouldn't close the account with a balance in it
1271691389: <dp> so, they just fucking overdrafted me
1271691391: <dp> *again*
1271691459: <]3d0g> Does this link work for anyone? https://plugins.atlassian.com/server/1.0/download/pluginVersion/19208
1271691579: --- fbxaway is now known as fbx
1271691581: <fbx> oi
1271691599: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: Nope.
1271691604: <]3d0g> thx
1271691605: <acr0nym> "The server at studio.plugins.atlassian.com is taking too long to respond."
1271691642: <]3d0g> I wanna round every goddamned person at that company up, from the CEO to the janitor, and shoot 'em all.
1271691689: <fbx> so...tell us how you really feel
1271691696: <]3d0g> I just did.
1271691702: <fbx> i know
1271691705: <acr0nym> They make Confluence, right?
1271691716: * ]3d0g spent 12 hours yesterday trying to upgrade their shitty Confluence software from 2.8 to 3.2.
1271691723: <fbx> man, you're mad to joke about it. that's no good.
1271691734: <acr0nym> Just the fact that they make Confluence is reason enough for killin'.
1271691840: <dp> we have code that magically disappears
1271691862: <dp> any thoughts on stuff that will email me when a file is deleted in a specific directory?
1271691899: <fbx> what platform?
1271691908: <dp> linux
1271691943: <fbx> we have a similar need on winders for when something is added to a particular directory. most apps that do it are shit.
1271691971: <dp> I think pyinotify may work for me
1271694844: <acr0nym> fbx: What windows version?
1271694939: <fbx> 2003 r2 would be nice, as that's the file server with the directory we'd like to monitor. otherwise, xp would do if it could monitor mapped drives.
1271694952: <acr0nym> Oh, see, 2008 is easy.
1271694959: <acr0nym> It's all built-in.
1271694960: <acr0nym> Heh.
1271694993: <fbx> indeed...i've thought of bringing a 2008 system online to play with that feature. what's the name again?
1271695005: <acr0nym> "Auditing" and "Event Monitor"
1271695006: <acr0nym> Heh.
1271695020: <fbx> i thought that feature had a specific name
1271695022: <fbx> hrm
1271695028: <fbx> wtf am i thinking of?
1271695043: <acr0nym> Oh, maybe some of the quota crap.
1271695045: <acr0nym> That's different, though.
1271695052: <acr0nym> It sends e-mail when you're over quota.
1271695144: <fbx> i can't tell you the number of times i've said "i want <linux/unix feature/app> for windows". truly sad.
1271695156: <fbx> inotify for winders would be nice
1271697266: <tinfoil> Heh, a bill collector looking for Ruiz kept calling my 303 number
1271697273: <tinfoil> Now they started calling my google voice number
1271697294: <tinfoil> I suspect google voice numbers are NOT unlisted
1271697734: <]3d0g> they're not. I just did a reverse lookup on mine.
1271697769: <tinfoil> That's annoying
1271697788: <tinfoil> LAst time this happened, they started sending letters to where I lived (like 8 years ago)
1271697806: <tinfoil> Back when I worked for coalfire
1271697813: <tinfoil> Totally different person though
1271697844: <tinfoil> That was when we were being harassed via our qwest hardline 8+ times a day for someone who had out number previously
1271697871: <tinfoil> One of the collectors got creative and found our address and started sending letters to the person.
1271697882: <tinfoil> (who never lived at our address, according to the landlord)
1271697912: <]3d0g> glue the letter to a brick and mark it "return to sender".
1271697940: <tinfoil> No, I asked them to stop calling 3+ times each, collected company names when they would give it
1271697945: <tinfoil> and threatened harassment charges
1271697976: <tinfoil> All but one stopped calling, and they had blocked caller id and refused to give their company name unless I said I was the person they were looking for
1271698019: <tinfoil> It took more effort to get the criminal part to sink in :-)
1271698067: <tinfoil> Sadly, the next landline we had was even worse, and it wasn't bill collectors
1271698119: <tinfoil> That was when we dropped qwest all together :-)
1271698130: <]3d0g> actually, if you have no prior business relationship with the company, just document the calls and file in small claims. $500/pop if I recall...
1271698162: <tinfoil> It was prior to the do not call list
1271698164: <tinfoil> 2002
1271698167: <tinfoil> 2001
1271698234: <]3d0g> ah
1271698281: <tinfoil> Our longmont landline was horrid.  Some deadbeat contractor either had our number, or gave it out.  We had dozens of angry people calling us threatening law suits and nothing we said would convince them we had no clue what they were talking about.
1271698292: <tinfoil> DOZENS
1271698324: <tinfoil> I'd like to blame Qwest :-)
1271698843: <TeleCon> Odd
1271698852: <tinfoil> Odd?
1271698852: <TeleCon> I've not had such issues.
1271698869: <tinfoil> Those were our only two lines in colorado
1271698897: <tinfoil> The only thing I can guess is that Qwest didn't put numbers into a hold-pool for a length of time before re-issuing
1271698942: <tinfoil> We discussed this in lobby about 5-6 years ago back when it was still on my server :-)
1271699429: <TeleCon> I hve no recollection.
1271699432: <TeleCon> Senator
1271700024: <tinfoil> :-)
1271700058: <tinfoil> Tried filming HD video with my DSLR over the weekend - Wow.  Did not realize how good quality it was.
1271700119: <tinfoil> only 720p/30fps, but my camera isn't the newest.
1271700175: <tinfoil> with the 50mm/f1.4 lens, it had great low-light ability and amazing depth of field control that no camcorder for less than $5000 can do.
1271700222: <tinfoil> Really want to upgrade now, so I can get 1080p :-)
1271700754: <fbx> canon, right?
1271701610: <tinfoil> Yeah
1271701741: <]3d0g> So that atlassian URL that wouldn't work? The cocksuckers got pwned badly last week. hackers got full dumps of all databases and total access to all code repositories. Atlassian has taken almost all their code offline to check it. Of course, ZERO notice to their customers...
1271701847: <tinfoil> I'm glad they produce tools that help make great software...should make it easier for them to figure out what's wrong.
1271701952: <dp> www.reddit.com/tb/bt3cp
1271702164: <]3d0g> hell of a scoop for the giz. 
1271702374: <tinfoil> Damn, that is pretty sweet looking
1271702406: <tinfoil> To bad apple is becoming more and more restrictive
1271702419: <tinfoil> Alas, if microsoft isn't good enough for the sheep, someone else has to be
1271702728: <]3d0g> Looks to me like the glass runs out to the edges. Fantastically shitty idea.
1271702927: <tinfoil> Possibly
1271702928: <dp> I just wish that there were a non-shitty Android phone for AT&T
1271702942: <tinfoil> the iphone was still the most durable phone I've used
1271702943: <]3d0g> There is. Nexus 1.
1271702945: <dp> I really don't think I want to upgrade to another iPhone, and be locked in to iTunes garbage
1271702952: <dp> ]3d0g: officially?
1271702970: <acr0nym> Yeah, it's out.
1271702976: <]3d0g> https://www.google.com/phone/choose?hl=en&gl=US&s7e=
1271703005: <dp> hrm
1271703025: <dp> I thought the nexus 1 was pretty crappy, in terms of 3g/wireless/etc
1271703033: <dp> wow.... $566
1271703057: <]3d0g> I think they got it all worked out. Haven't heard any nexus bitching lately.
1271703070: <dp> didn't someone in here have the nexus?
1271703073: <]3d0g> several
1271703161: <acr0nym> Me, TeleCon, milkchan....
1271703237: <dp> when did you all switch?  last I knew, you had the G1
1271703255: <acr0nym> Umm, when we had the big conversation about the Nexus One being released?
1271703262: <acr0nym> All of us ordered it on release day.
1271703267: <dp> ha
1271703645: <]3d0g> anyone landed an iPad yet?
1271703794: <tinfoil> No Nexus1 on Verizon - yet... but it's being workedon
1271703795: <dp> couple of people at work have
1271703801: <tinfoil> Anyone have the Nexus-1 cardock?
1271703806: <acr0nym> Yeah.
1271703817: <tinfoil> Does it have an audio jack?
1271703830: <]3d0g> use bluepoop
1271703835: <acr0nym> Not that I recall.  But, I wasn't looking for one.
1271703846: <tinfoil> ]3d0g:  I'd have to upgrade my stereo for that
1271703857: <]3d0g> naw, get a bluepoop receiver. 
1271703866: <]3d0g> like $12 from DX.
1271703869: <tinfoil> With a casset adaptor?
1271703875: <tinfoil> :-)
1271703879: <tinfoil> Not bad
1271703883: <tinfoil> What is DX?
1271703886: <tinfoil> brand?
1271703888: <acr0nym> dealextreme
1271703890: <]3d0g> http://www.dealextreme.com/
1271703911: <acr0nym> Just bear in mind that it genuinely comes on the slow boat from China.  ;)
1271703931: <]3d0g> man, no kidding. Took over a month to "process" my last order before it got shipped.
1271703947: <tinfoil> So don't bother paying for overnight :-)
1271703980: <tinfoil> I love that when sites offer expidited or overnight shipping, but then take a week or more to process the order
1271704114: <dp> wow
1271704120: <dp> 30 total users on irc.dp.cx
1271704123: <dp> *crazy*
1271706033: <tinfoil> 45k elements changed in AD over the weekend (several migrations at once).  Tripwire refuses to report them all in HTML.  :-)
1271706252: <tinfoil> Trying elements view
1271706265: <tinfoil> Might have to search based on specific rules
1271706918: <tinfoil> What's really funny is that I'm tracking 40+ linux hosts and they change less than 8 windows hosts.
1271706928: <tinfoil> (and I'm not tracking active directory
1271708463: <dp> installed redshift
1271708484: <dp> amazing how much difference there is between the colors
1271708710: <dp> are the N1s on * the same as they are on AT&T, or are there hardware differences?
1271708743: <]3d0g> what's * ?
1271708757: <dp> anything but AT&T ;)
1271708774: <]3d0g> heh, yes, hardware differences. each uses different frequencies.
1271708779: <dp> ah
1271708782: <dp> suck
1271708812: <dp> yeah, I refuse to pay that much money for a phone

1271709051: <acr0nym> Heh, oops: http://www.boingboing.net/2010/04/19/cookbook-typo-salt-a.html
1271709084: <dp> except that they don't take in to account that they only reason that's cheaper, is because it's on a different network.  using AT&T, the TCO is the same, or higher, than with the iPhone
1271709104: <]3d0g> Oh, come on. Who doesn't have fresh ground black people in the cupboard?
1271709165: <]3d0g> good point dp
1271710099: <tinfoil> I will make an argument about the 16k applications in the android marketplace - 15000 of them are the same few programs with a slightly different theme, each all of them pay.
1271710178: <tinfoil> I am all for an open market place - and don't mind that people want to charge $$$ for different themed versions of their application (it's their perogative), but having a seperate application page for that is essencially spam.

1271717424: <tinfoil> cute song

1271719355: <dp> the game is good

1271777319: <]3d0g> Interesting? More like blindingly obvious IMO. 
1271777639: <acr0nym> Well, it's interesting to see it laid out, I guess.  Do you really think it's blindingly obvious for the vast majority of people out there?  Like, your management?
1271777728: <]3d0g> management needs a phone and maybe and etch-a-sketch to be productive.

1271782880: <tinfoil> Anyway, recommend Moon
1271782883: <tinfoil> highly recommend Moon
1271782889: <tinfoil> Don't read the synopsis
1271782900: <tinfoil> rather, don't read spoilers
1271782906: <acr0nym> tinfoil: Stop toying with dp.
1271782936: <]3d0g> Moon was fantastic.
1271783111: <fbx> moon? might have to check that out
1271783153: <acr0nym> Yeah, I want to see it.
1271783155: <fbx> please tell me you don't mean "new moon"?

1271783670: <fbx> heh
1271783678: <acr0nym> Heh, it's been out for about 9 months, if I recall right.
1271783687: <]3d0g> Huh? It was from last year's Sundance. 
1271783695: <]3d0g> It's on DVD now.

1271783805: <fbx> i figured 3 months was a pretty short run
1271783919: <dp> wtf
1271783930: <dp> why is it so difficult to use an ipod under linux?
1271783993: <acr0nym> Steve Jobs hates Open Software?
1271783995: <]3d0g> because closed systems and open systems are like oil and water?
1271784013: <]3d0g> why the fuck are you using an ipod anyway?
1271784046: <dp> because it's what I have
1271784055: <fbx> but ipods just work when you don't use linux ;)
1271784115: <]3d0g> I don't use a player since getting a smart phone, but when I did, the Archos products were far better than anything Apple put out.
1271784144: <dp> I don't want to use the iPhone as a player, since it has *no* linux support
1271784268: <]3d0g> yeah, but at least it can be standalone with podcatchers, streaming audio, etc.
1271785020: <acr0nym> Oooh, I like the new TARDIS console.
1271785140: <dp> tardis?
1271785147: <dp> is't that a Dr. Who thing?
1271785152: <acr0nym> Correct.
1271785166: <acr0nym> But, it's a backronym.  Spell it right.
1271785335: <fbx> so if you didn't have an ipod, what would you get...that I assume would be usable with linux and possibly other OSes
1271785338: <fbx> ?
1271785392: <]3d0g> Archos.
1271785419: <fbx> so you'd stick with that?
1271785422: <acr0nym> Android.  :)
1271785425: <fbx> ah
1271785430: <acr0nym> fbx: He's stuck with it for MANY years.
1271785439: <fbx> really? nice
1271785455: <acr0nym> TeleCon has gone through some Archos devices, too.
1271785494: <fbx> wow...comparatively cheap
1271785603: <dp> ]3d0g: which do you have?
1271785680: <]3d0g> 404. It's an old product. 
1271785697: <]3d0g> That Vision 3 looks nice.
1271785714: <dp> www.archos.com/products/mp3_players/archos_3/index.html?country=us&lang=en -- that one?
1271785723: <]3d0g> yeah
1271785745: <]3d0g> One thing I loved about my Archos is that it was very un-picky about video formats.
1271785758: <dp> wow... $77
1271785764: <dp> www.amazon.com/Archos-Vision-Video-Player-Chocolate/dp/B002GHBW16
1271785835: <dp> doesn't look like it has support for ogg or flac
1271785883: <]3d0g> On my old one, it was a free driver addition for those. I'm not up on latest archos tech though.
1271785916: <dp> still
1271785925: <dp> $77, and if it works under linux, that might be worth it
1271785950: <fbx> damn...i was hoping for a 40GB version
1271785952: <fbx> or more
1271785954: <dp> lol
1271785966: * fbx is a dick about having his whole catalog on the ipod
1271786008: <fbx> i coulda left off the "about having..." prolly
1271786048: <dp> I need some more podcasts...
1271786052: <]3d0g> that 3 does OGG and FLAC out of the box.
1271786068: <]3d0g> MP3, WMA (non protected files), WAV, OGG, FLAC           
1271786074: <dp> http://gpodder.net/user/gms8994/subscriptions?token=IQbXNMqpcxGy6FgzaVWkP87tmjenOLBE
1271786165: <]3d0g> dp: do note that archos is a French company. The French have strange laws regarding audio output limits. 
1271786181: <]3d0g> Meaning, get some good buds to go with it.
1271786274: <]3d0g> fbx: my Archos 404 is 30G. It indeed holds (and backs up) our music server @ home.
1271786649: <acr0nym> Heh: http://www.boingboing.net/2010/04/20/dalek-propaganda-pos.html
1271789505: <TeleCon> ow
1271790018: <tinfoil> Ugh, I'm going to take heat for converting a box to a desktop system in the new datacenter
1271790035: <tinfoil> Even though I was asked to do it
1271790046: <tinfoil> Love corporate environments
1271793770: <dp> if and when I get paid for this job, I'll probably get one of those Archos devices
1271794592: <fbx> ]3d0g: so what's the current version of the 404? i'm looking, but if you know...
1271794689: <]3d0g> I believe archos evolved that whole line into their Internet tablets.
1271794700: <fbx> yeah...looks like it
1271794710: <]3d0g> 4 series to 5 to 6, then tablets.
1271794980: <fbx> http://amzn.to/bRXd1B
1271794985: <fbx> look familiar?
1271795019: <dp> ]3d0g: is that an actual spinning disk (I assume yes)
1271795023: <dp> on your 404 that is
1271795138: <fbx> i wonder how used these are: http://amzn.to/cbpYOj
1271795225: <]3d0g> yup. that's it
1271795268: <fbx> hrm...now i have to get it attached to my stereo in the car...wonder if i can attach a USB jack to the aux port of a stock 2003 vibe stereo...
1271795403: <]3d0g> The mrs. truck has a stereo with a USB input. When I plug in the Archos it takes a while to chew through all the directories - like 2-3 minutes - but then it works perfectly and everything's selectable from the stereo.
1271795434: <acr0nym> Damn, I wish my car had either a USB port, or a 1/8" stereo aux.
1271795457: <]3d0g> i want bluepoop in my next stereo.
1271795469: <acr0nym> Yeah, actually, that'd work fine, too.  Heh.
1271795473: <]3d0g> Or even better, Ford's sync.
1271795498: <]3d0g> Sync is arguably the best thing to ever come out of Microsoft.
1271795576: <acr0nym> That, I know nothing about.
1271795596: <]3d0g> http://www.fordvehicles.com/technology/sync/
1271795618: <acr0nym> Oh, see, I didn't really need to, either, since I'll never likely have a Ford.
1271795630: <fbx> i don't even need that...in fact, i have a dLo transdock for the ipod currently
1271795670: <fbx> i just select on the ipod, the dLo tunes to dead air, and i tune the stereo to the dLO station. bob is my uncle.
1271795673: <]3d0g> Ford Escape is presently at the top of our list for the mrs next ride.
1271795688: <acr0nym> But then she won't be the Mayor anymore!
1271795709: <]3d0g> by this time next year, definitely not.
1271795715: <fbx> actually, i could get away with a 3.5" jack in for aux, provided that 505 has an output for it
1271795724: <acr0nym> Hrm.  I disapprove.
1271795735: <fbx> then i have to find a charger and i'm good.
1271795740: <fbx> acr0nym: with what?
1271795753: <acr0nym> ]3d0g's whiff not being the Mayor of Trucktown.
1271795758: <acr0nym> Heh.
1271795965: <fbx> http://www.installer.com/item/display_item.php?it=FMM-100
1271795975: <fbx> and an rca dual to 3.5 should do it
1271795980: <fbx> i might have to try that
1271796013: <fbx> biggest bitch is getting to the back of my stock stereo to install that thing
1271796036: <dp> trucktown?
1271796055: <dp> that seems like it should be a game
1271796100: <acr0nym> Heh, old ad for Ford, I think....
1271796184: <acr0nym> Wow, who would think that traffic would be getting crappy around CU on 4/20? http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=boulder,+co&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=48.374125,125.332031&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Boulder,+Colorado&ll=40.015783,-105.272455&spn=0.046014,0.122395&z=14&layer=t
1271796255: <acr0nym> Good thing I went home early.  ;)
1271796274: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: You gonna show up at Josh's thing?
1271796377: <fbx> http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=120554202987&rvr_id=&crlp=1_263602_263622&UA=WXF%3F&GUID=1cf881ea1280a0aad242d122ff1d73fd&itemid=120554202987&ff4=263602_263622
1271796386: <fbx> and there's the radio transmitter for the archos
1271796457: <fbx> this might be realllllly doable. and the wife can have the ipod
1271797155: <]3d0g> acr0 - naw. Don't think he'd want his boss around.
1271797948: --- fbx is now known as fbxhome
1271797953: <fbxhome> ok, enough for me

1271856067: <dp> damn
1271856071: <dp> so, wait
1271856084: <dp> you were only ~30 when I started IRCing
1271856087: <dp> fuck
1271856088: <fbx> chloe still says "daddy, you're not old until you're 60, so i don't think you're old. yet."
1271856094: <dp> I've been on this bitch for 12 years?
1271856101: * dp hangs head
1271856102: <fbx> indeed
1271856138: <fbx> it was 2000 sometime when i joined anc's original #distributed
1271856145: <fbx> october mebbe?
1271856155: <dp> I wonder how far back my logs go
1271856184: <dp> hrm... I know I've got stuff from before then
1271856187: <fbx> seemed like a good portion of the DCP board at ars was like "we want an unofficial # away from caesar, since he's a dick."
1271856197: <dp> at one point, I had IRC logs from '02
1271856211: <fbx> i heard caesar on NPR the other day talking about computing something
1271856217: <fbx> it was like "WTF?!?!?"
1271856218: <fbx> surreal
1271856218: <dp> haha
1271856255: <fbx> i wanted to send an email saying "he's all professional now, but he was a cast iron cunt back in the day."
1271856302: <fbx> i actually re-created an account on ars board and went back to say hello to the folks i remembered. got no responses
1271856306: <fbx> sad really
1271856307: <fbx> oh
1271856315: <fbx> i need to contact dyy, i believe
1271856319: <dp> why?
1271856333: <fbx> my original fbx login for freedc...i don't know the password
1271856344: <dp> there's a reset, IIRC
1271856350: <dp> though
1271856351: <fbx> and resetting it would send a reset confirm to furballexpress@bumpass.org
1271856356: <dp> good point
1271856360: <fbx> i don't have such an email anymore
1271856361: <dp> actually
1271856365: <dp> I'm an "admin"
1271856367: <dp> I think
1271856368: <fbx> yay!
1271856369: <dp> lemme see
1271856387: <fbx> i wonder if you could repoint the email to furballexpress@gmail.com
1271856409: <fbx> it's not like dyy has no clue who i am, but it's been ages, so....
1271856428: <dp> ha!

1271857384: <fbx> well...i'd say biden's the more qualified of those two, but the statement on the picture probably holds true anyway
1271857402: <fbx> biden says some weird and/or stupid shit sometimes
1271857433: <dp> I'd still let Palin put it in her mouth, if you know what I mean ;)
1271857575: <fbx> your invisible dick? well, sure.

1271857607: * fbx wonders where telecon is when you really need him
1271859396: --> ]3d0g (jkarp@6988929A.F4AE6A51.BF63E968.IP) has joined #lobby
1271860397: <acr0nym> It took one of my cow-orkers 2 hours to get home from Boulder yesterday.....
1271860401: <acr0nym> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdZE3i6VpJk
1271860461: <]3d0g> Got distracted by a 7-11 stocked with cheetos?
1271860487: <acr0nym> No, she left around 5, and it was just a complete cluster, apparently.
1271860532: * ]3d0g is pleased by the turnout. Eventually, people will get a clue.
1271860915: <acr0nym> Heh.
1271861495: <dp> turnout?
1271861535: <acr0nym> 4/20?  Yesterday?  Big marijuana fests?
1271861546: <dp> he said "is pleased"
1271861549: <dp> I was confused
1271861554: <dp> grammar is hard
1271861565: <acr0nym> ]3d0g believes in marijuana legalization.
1271861572: <acr0nym> Oh, well, for that matter, so do I.
1271861620: <dp> I do as well
1271861629: <dp> my point is, he was talking about yesterday
1271861636: <dp> but he said "is pleased".
1271861643: <dp> past event, should be past tense
1271861649: <]3d0g> not really
1271861653: <acr0nym> nope.
1271861655: <dp> why?
1271861656: <]3d0g> I am STILL pleased by it.
1271861659: <acr0nym> I am pleased by the turnout (that we got yesterday).
1271861661: <]3d0g> Even today.
1271861676: <acr0nym> Yeah, gramatically fine.
1271861684: <dp> meh
1271861689: <dp> meeting
1271861698: <acr0nym> Luck.

1271863603: <fbx> heh
1271863621: <]3d0g> yeah, I'm an asshole.
1271863666: <TeleCon> Yes, my eat infection.
1271863710: <]3d0g> Why is facefail suggesting I friend this very young looking Asian girl?

1271863835: <tinfoil> You guys play much with the adblock element hiding helper addon?  In advanced mode it's pretty damn powerful.  (like you can block specific elements based upon their hierarchy, so even if the specific element doesn't have a class or ID, and the one above it doesn't, but the one above that does, you can still block it)
1271863903: <TeleCon> acr0nym: I'd call that a reason to go to starfest.
1271863910: <TeleCon> Looks familiar, too
1271863912: <acr0nym> Yeah.  It was a crazy weekend.
1271863918: <acr0nym> Heh, yeah, that's Summer Glau.
1271863932: <TeleCon> Oh yeah, that would explain it.
1271864010: <acr0nym> It would have been nice, indeed, to make it to Starfest.  Just didn't happen this year.
1271864083: <TeleCon> Was that last weekend?
1271864090: <acr0nym> Yep.
1271864184: <tinfoil> Summer looks pretty akward looking
1271864184: <TeleCon> Oh well

1271868074: <dp> since we were down 3,000 for the quarter, cutting out those meetings would have saved us enough to be positive!
1271869273: <acr0nym> I love running into a system that has a vulnerability reported in 2006.....

1271869543: <dp> shitton sounds weird
1271869817: <]3d0g> go metric. Then you've got metric fuckton at your disposal. 
1271870482: <tinfoil> didn't nasa go metric?
1271870495: <tinfoil> Metric fuck-tun
1271870517: <]3d0g> Didn't they also go back?

1271870717: <tinfoil> So, what's the difference of a standard vs. metric fuckton
1271870721: <tinfoil> ?
1271870768: <tinfoil> Oh ]3d0g, youtube for stepper motors mario brothers.  Someone used stepper motors to make music.  Figured you might find that interesting
1271870769: <]3d0g> your European friends will look with contempt on you and your standard fuckton. 
1271870801: <]3d0g> How did I not know about this? http://golang.org/
1271870833: <]3d0g> Thompson's writing it for the Goog.
1271870873: <acr0nym> Umm, dude, Thompson's dead.  They shot him out of a cannon.
1271870881: <]3d0g> not THAT one
1271870883: <acr0nym> Heh.
1271870885: <acr0nym> Who's this one?
1271870901: <]3d0g> Some ass who wrote a silly little language called C.
1271870999: <acr0nym> Huh.  Whacky.
1271871102: <acr0nym> This says he wrote B: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_%28programming_language%29
1271871191: <dp> he wrote both

1271871265: <]3d0g> nothing considering I wasn't aware of its existence until 30 minutes ago.
1271871271: <dp> oh
1271871293: <]3d0g> But, the father of C, funded by Google, writing a new language, gets my attention.
1271871294: <dp> then why the comment "How did I not know about this?" -- why should you have known about it?
1271871300: <dp> ah
1271871351: <]3d0g> 1st RHEL 6 beta out. lordy.
1271871368: <]3d0g> 64K core support.
1271871401: <dp> mmmm... 64K cores
1271871402: <dp> yes please

1271871926: <tinfoil> ]3d0g: interesting, thanks :-)
1271877035: <tinfoil> Bleh
1271877053: <acr0nym> Bleh, indeed.
1271877095: <tinfoil> you guys having any issues connecting to the amazon mp3 store
1271877095: <tinfoil> ?
1271877102: <acr0nym> I wouldn't know.
1271877114: <tinfoil> my searches time out via wifi or evdo
1271877121: <tinfoil> (on droid, not web)
1271878433: <dp> ugh... sleepy
1271879587: <]3d0g> came right up for me tinfoil. #1 song today is "Need You Now" by Lady Antebellum.
1271879617: <]3d0g> ugh, it sucks too
1271879623: <acr0nym> Were you on EVDO or Wifi?
1271879626: <acr0nym> or 3g?
1271879627: <acr0nym> Heh.
1271879635: <]3d0g> wieeee fieeeee
1271879651: <]3d0g> think the song would suck less on 3g?
1271879671: <acr0nym> No, helping out tinfoil's query.
1271879706: <dp> lady antebellum?
1271879708: <dp> wtf?
1271879711: <tinfoil> acr0nym: It started working
1271879746: <acr0nym> Oh, good, good.

1271880266: <acr0nym> Hrmm.  I don't believe so, currently.
1271880545: <acr0nym> Damn.  I may have to start Dr. Who over from Eccleston again.
1271880583: <dp> hrm... dual 3GHz Xeons... I wonder if I could "borrow" this box at the datacenter for a while... it's been off, so
1271881046: * fbx blinks
1271881067: <dp> fbx: crunching still?
1271881080: <fbx> ok, so...don't allow someone in the DC to start pulling power cords too hard because it can disturb other cords
1271881097: <acr0nym> Don't allow anyone to do anything in the datacenter without a change request.  ;)
1271881104: <fbx> when the other is one specifically attached to the main data center switch, that's not good
1271881111: <fbx> well, we had the change
1271881127: <fbx> he just pulled too hard on the power cord, which dislodged power to that switch
1271881138: <fbx> and part of the DC was cut off from the world
1271881140: <fbx> not good
1271881145: <acr0nym> Well, a clean, well-routed datacenter would help with that, too.
1271881146: <acr0nym> Heh.
1271881156: * fbx blinks
1271881161: <fbx> no
1271881166: <fbx> VRRP working helps that
1271881170: <acr0nym> That, too.
1271881171: <acr0nym> Heh.
1271881176: <fbx> dual PSUs on the main switch helps that
1271881186: <fbx> but i don't have either right at this moment
1271881194: <fbx> however
1271881202: <fbx> i just got my funding to finish that up
1271881204: <fbx> :)
1271881262: <tinfoil> Gah, kinda wish I was allowed to take over the rocky mountain internet exchange - had a plan to make it totally redundant (routers and switches) for like $1500
1271881317: <tinfoil> But it's nice to not have to deal with Alf any more
1271881336: <acr0nym> Yeah, people who run ISP's turn out to tend to be pretty serious whackjobs.
1271881771: <tinfoil> Hehe... I wrote a tripwire rule to check and see if a specific configuration line exists in /etc/syslog.conf
1271881784: <tinfoil> if it doesn't, add it and restart sysklogd
1271881816: <tinfoil> suddenly overnight most of the linux hosts started logging to envision
1271881826: <dp> envision?

1271882420: <tinfoil> What is the server handling?

1271883542: <tinfoil> Nah, they were good once
1271883545: <tinfoil> like in 1995
1271883593: <]3d0g> nope. I made a ton of money right about then recovering an Exchange server for Avaya that McAfee flat ate up.
1271883624: <tinfoil> Exchange existed then?
1271883625: <tinfoil> Damn

1271892610: <tinfoil> And beyond!
1271894104: <tinfoil> Damn, I ordered a bunch of stuff on amazon last night.  One key item, and some other nicknacks
1271894107: <tinfoil> all the nicknacks shipped
1271894141: <tinfoil> Thankfully I don't need the key item until a week from Saturday, so I'm not upset.... just want to use it (new lens)
1271895004: <TeleCon> I have lens envy
1271895014: <TeleCon> Is it a big long lense?
1271895405: <tinfoil> No, short and stubby
1271895415: <tinfoil> Sigma 30mm f/1.4
1271895429: <tinfoil> I have a 50mm f/1.4 now
1271895479: <tinfoil> but with 1.6x magnification it acts like 80mm
1271895507: <tinfoil> so the 30mm gets me to effective 48mm
1271895551: <tinfoil> Was debating getting a 20mm
1271895558: <tinfoil> will wait on that.  :-)
1271898422: <dp> ugh
1271898433: <dp> gotta build the admin section
1271900221: <TeleCon> All I have are zoom lenses right now.  I've been considering some fixed lenght ones though.

1271950210: <acr0nym> Oh, I'm in a "Support Community Event".
1271950213: <acr0nym> It is paiful.
1271950216: <acr0nym> painful, even.
1271950232: <dp> nice
1271950258: <dp> hrm
1271950269: <dp> how do I turn off dns lookups for remote connections?
1271950282: <dp> takes entirely too long to connect to this box
1271950444: <acr0nym> I'm feeling kind, you're NOT getting a "lmgtfy" link: http://www.yaleman.org/2007/12/09/ssh-reverse-dns-lookup-disable/
1271950553: <dp> it's not just ssh though :(
1271950566: <dp> but I'll give that a try too
1271950600: <acr0nym> What else is doing DNS lookups?
1271950606: <dp> mysql, apparently
1271950642: <acr0nym> http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/dns.html
1271950665: <acr0nym> "You can disable DNS host name lookups by starting mysqld with the --skip-name-resolve option. However, in this case, you can use only IP numbers in the MySQL grant tables. "
1271950699: <dp> the UseDNS no setting didn't seem to do much
1271950706: <dp> wonder if pam has anything
1271950739: <acr0nym> Did you restart sshd?
1271950775: <dp> of course ;)
1271950790: <acr0nym> Weird.  That should have taken care of it.

1271956902: <dp> and the guy ain't that good ;)
1271957001: <acr0nym> Seriously.  Those guys have some DOUCHEBAGS on.
1271957010: <acr0nym> So did Santa, for that matter.
1271957397: <TeleCon> which guest?
1271957405: <TeleCon> Oh.

1271960096: <dp> luckily, 7.5 installs
1271960199: <acr0nym> Hey, anyone know an easy way to extract from a BIN/CUE CD image?

1271960573: <acr0nym> Oh, wait, I loaded something that's supposed to mount it.  Just need to reboot.
1271960574: <acr0nym> Heh.
1271961306: <tinfoil> Reboot?
1271961309: <tinfoil> What are you running, windows?
1271961313: <acr0nym> Yeah.
1271961318: <tinfoil> *twitch*
1271961321: <acr0nym> Well, the machine I loaded the tool on is Win7.
1271961352: <tinfoil> I like how amazon can sync my shopping cart to my account if I login
1271961542: <dp> UPDATE cart SET ownerId = <tinfoil> WHERE session_id = <tinfoils session id>;
1271961550: <acr0nym> Really?  That seems hardly in keeping with "tinfoil.paranoia".
1271961553: <tinfoil> Argh, they deployed 72 machines with iptables on it, AFTER we asked them to disabled iptables since we have 17 firwalls.
1271961559: <tinfoil> (in the datacenter)
1271961587: <tinfoil> acr0nym: You have to be logged in for it to work
1271961594: <dp> hrm.... I'm not so sure about smodcast
1271961603: <acr0nym> Heh.  
1271961632: <tinfoil> So now they have to go touch 72 machines to disable iptables
1271961641: <tinfoil> versus just disabling it on the image

1271961863: <tinfoil> I miss grufty bot
1271961885: <tinfoil> the most use functionality was leaving messages for other users, and quoting music

1271965074: <tinfoil> Had an interesting discussion yesterday with a friend... We concluded that Star Trek and Star Wars are Fantacy more than SciFi
1271965087: <]3d0g> no argument here.

1271965155: <tinfoil> How is it?
1271965176: <acr0nym> Riiight, because both the forcefield AND the FTL drive, and THOSE are science-based.....
1271965190: <tinfoil> The conversation came out of a discussion about "Moon" and "Sunshine" and how I felt that they were the best science fiction movies I've seen in years
1271965225: <]3d0g> Both are excellent flicks
1271965248: <tinfoil> The agreement was based on that most good science fiction stories are based in science, with limited leaps taken for a plot device
1271965267: <tinfoil> If everything you do is a leap loosly based on science if at all, that's fantacy
1271965339: <tinfoil> Opinions?
1271965421: <acr0nym> I like motorcycles.  And, Tenacious D.  I think that gay people are equally as good as straight people.
1271965441: <]3d0g> You forgot turtles. 
1271965445: <acr0nym> Meh.
1271965533: <tinfoil> Where do turtles fall on the Love-Fear line?

1272042977: <dp> I think I'm gonna remove my facebook account too

1272043174: <milkchan> google i can't live without. facebook is just more noise
1272043213: <dp> google wants the information for themselves
1272043220: <dp> facebook is going to want to sell that shit
1272043238: <dp> I'm less fearful of google than facebook
1272043534: <tinfoil> I use facebook to let my family know I'm alive, at this point
1272043567: <fbx> i may have to once-remove my FB from my primary email
1272043585: <fbx> dp: what's scary now that wasn't before?
1272043921: <]3d0g> fbx: FB created tons of groups based on profile data and auto-joined you. Also changed profile info visibility to everyone.
1272043952: <dp> and the "instant" bullshit
1272043981: <milkchan> plus, i got tired of "xmit only" friends
1272044003: <dp> xmit only?
1272044039: <milkchan> yah.  people that i don't have dialogs with, but they wear their electronic hearts on their sleeves
1272044051: <milkchan> i know more than i want to know about everyyyything in their lives
1272044054: <fbx> hrm
1272044071: <fbx> i'm looking through all my "connections" and haven't found one i didn't add yet
1272044075: <fbx> are they hidden?
1272044150: <dp> developers.facebook.com/docs/api
1272044162: <dp> then click the "me/friends" link
1272044208: <milkchan> it just got to a point where i couldn't trust FB to host data i wanted to keep private and that it would STAY private without me having to check every setting every day
1272044224: <milkchan> my data is mine.  they lost their rights to store it
1272044314: <fbx> fair enough, milkchan 
1272044372: <fbx> i guess i hadn't noticed because i'm going through deleting apps and groups anyway
1272044580: <]3d0g> I don't think the updates are fully deployed yet. When I went in to FB this morning it brought up a dialog asking me to "reconfirm" my interests, activities, etc. with new group pages for each auto-joined. When I removed myself, it deleted the corresponding interest from my profile. You can't list anything in your profile w/o being part of that group.  It wouldn't even save my Current City because they didn't have a page created for Elizabeth, CO.
1272044622: <]3d0g> So I had to nuke all interests, favorite movies, music, etc.
1272044654: <fbx> FB is at it again. SHARING your personal information: As of today, there is a new privacy setting called "Instant Personalization" that shares data with non-facebook websites and it is automatically set to "Allow." Go to Account > Privacy Settings > Applications and Websites and uncheck "Allow"--it's at the bottom of the page. Please copy & repost
1272044664: <fbx> that's the status on two friends of mine
1272044668: <fbx> i've already done that
1272044671: <]3d0g> yup, also new
1272044698: <]3d0g> clearly, FB is all about monetizing now
1272044749: <fbx> that's OK...they'll lose their crowd as soon as they go the full way of myspace
1272044755: <fbx> they're about 50% there now
1272044762: <milkchan> their mistake is thinking that they're irreplacable 
1272044768: <fbx> hah
1272044776: <fbx> not sure why they'd think that
1272044781: <milkchan> volume
1272044787: <milkchan> you HAVE to be on facebook to be ANYone
1272044790: <fbx> FB > myspace > whatever was before
1272044804: <fbx> but that equation is open to the left
1272044810: <TeleCon> Everyone can go to orkut instead, and give google the info.
1272044818: <fbx> next big thing before it's monetized > FB > ...

1272044869: <milkchan> from twitter and fb
1272044876: <fbx> i just don't relish doing all my photos again
1272044922: <fbx> it's almost like we have to go back to the ancala model: MY web server, and you need an account FROM ME before you can see my pics
1272044940: <fbx> cuz that's half of my facebook experience
1272044957: <fbx> it's easy to get kid pics to the family
1272044968: <tinfoil> Yep
1272044976: <fbx> the other half is prolly mouse hunt at this point ;)
1272044980: <tinfoil> I use facebook for posting vanilla pictures to all my family 
1272044999: <milkchan> why can't you do that with flickr or piccassa?
1272045011: <milkchan> lot less social baggage there
1272045016: <fbx> true
1272045038: <fbx> then again, i don't have to friend all the folks i have on FB either

1272045123: <milkchan> no offense mike
1272045128: <]3d0g> I'm considering nuking everything on FB, opening up my visibility to everyone and the only thing that ever gets posted is the RSS from my blog.
1272045392: <milkchan> time to go back to compartmentalized email addresses and register with pseudonyms
1272045784: <milkchan> least the latest cyanogenmod is working nicely 
1272045834: <fbx> milkchan: define flub?
1272045854: * fbx doesn't post anything outrageous on FB he doesn't think the world wouldn't see at some point
1272045876: <fbx> to me, what's digital is public with few small trusted exceptions
1272045905: <fbx> if you're saying things you don't want rebroadcast IRL on FB, you've already jumped the shark
1272045922: <milkchan> flub - setting or parameter mis-set
1272045936: <fbx> that's why i say "motherfuck this day already" IN HERE, not on FB
1272045953: <fbx> if any of you bitches tell folks what i'm saying, i kill ya

1272301820: <tinfoil> dp:  Yep. they've been recommending the Droid until the Nexus is released for verizon
1272301824: <tinfoil> no ETA available.
1272301848: <acr0nym> Nope, that's new.  The HTC Incredible.
1272301853: <acr0nym> The original Droid is Motorola.
1272301859: <tinfoil> Ohhh
1272301865: <tinfoil> I did't see the HTC
1272301876: <tinfoil> Considering my experience with HTC, I'll never use another one
1272301888: <tinfoil> was the crappiest smart phone I've used
1272301893: <tinfoil> And they never supported it
1272301906: <acr0nym> Which HTC was that?
1272301909: <tinfoil> 2125
1272301912: <acr0nym> Oh, the SDA thing?
1272301938: <]3d0g> Man, I've been massively impressed with HTC.
1272301965: <acr0nym> Yeah, it was Cingular that let the 2125 go to crap.  Heh.
1272301996: <tinfoil> I went to HTC's website looking for firmware upgrades
1272302000: <tinfoil> they provided them for other phones
1272302044: <acr0nym> Yeah, but, it's the phone company that dictates that crap, contractually.  T-Mobile didn't do much for that line of phones, either.
1272302067: <tinfoil> Phone companies suck
1272302070: <acr0nym> Yep.
1272302084: <fbx> they're not the only ones
1272302086: <acr0nym> That's why I have a phone made by HTC for Google, not for a phone company.
1272302087: <acr0nym> Heh.
1272302108: <tinfoil> Now if only google would start fixing annoyances and catch up to the iphone :-)

1272302277: <tinfoil> it
1272302288: <tinfoil> the same people who complain about MS being opressive :-)
1272302327: <tinfoil> Granted, I'll say that the iphone does something no windows mobile phone did
1272302328: <fbx> i might actually be able to like steve jobs, even though he's an asshole from time to time
1272302333: <tinfoil> it works
1272302336: <fbx> steve ballmer? no fucking way
1272302339: <fbx> ;)
1272302459: <tinfoil> jobs is a pinko commie bastard
1272302519: <fbx> still doesn't and ballmer is a capitalist fucktarded pig. your point?
1272302533: <fbx> s/still doesn't/.../;
1272302600: <fbx> and i don't really believe jobs is a communist. fascist i'd believe easier.
1272302603: <fbx> same with ballmer
1272302618: <fbx> "do it our way. or die....your choice."

1272303997: <tinfoil> Oh, I had changed context a while back
1272304001: <tinfoil> was wondering what you meant
1272304018: <tinfoil> I don't get it
1272304031: <tinfoil> How can 8 windows machines change more in a weekend than 70 linux machines?
1272304043: <tinfoil> Total windows changes:  1799
1272304047: <tinfoil> Total linux changes:  708
1272304054: <tinfoil> That makes no sense to me

1272473814: <tinfoil> I said my requirements
1272473826: <tinfoil> Someone asked me a question about how long it would take me to get it live
1272473843: <]3d0g> Good thing I abandoned ICQ. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/28/icq_sold/
1272473852: <tinfoil> I said I wouldn't be bringing it live unless we migrated (in a disaster)
1272473854: <tinfoil> they asked why
1272473883: <tinfoil> I said tripwire wasn't designed for DR, and if the network goes down it's one of the last things you'll care about bringing it back up (assuming mass outtage)
1272473894: <tinfoil> They suddenly look at the DR manager
1272473903: <tinfoil> who was pushing tripwire as a priority 0 setup
1272473918: <tinfoil> (ie - before anything in the backup datacenter is brought online except the network)
1272473950: <tinfoil> Wow, didn't ICQ start to suck in like 1997?

1272479181: <tinfoil> it's internally routable
1272479195: <tinfoil> so accidently putting the rule on the external firewall won't do any good.

1272546607: <tinfoil> It's way too early
1272546621: <dp> agreed
1272546626: <dp> but it's like 6 there, isn't it?
1272546632: <tinfoil> yeah
1272546642: <dp> why are you up?
1272546666: <tinfoil> Spent the night at Tracy's which means I need to be up at 5 (when she goes to work)
1272546675: <dp> ugh
1272546676: <dp> so
1272546678: <dp> ...
1272546686: <tinfoil> I'm at work now
1272546688: <dp> I started looking at mongodb last night
1272546693: <tinfoil> Figured I wanted to come in early anyway :-)
1272546699: <tinfoil> how is it"?
1272546720: <dp> it's an interesting concept
1272546740: <dp> I'm not completely sure how to map an existing relational database to the mongo way of thinking though
1272546788: <tinfoil> oh
1272546794: <tinfoil> it's a document oriented db
1272546801: <dp> I know
1272546810: <tinfoil> no, just commenting
1272546812: <tinfoil> reading more
1272546814: <dp> ah
1272546837: <dp> replication apparently is *super* easy
1272546840: <tinfoil> It operates like google does :-)
1272546851: <dp> yep
1272546854: <tinfoil> perhaps not as efficient
1272546870: <dp> perhaps
1272546881: <dp> but if you need Google scale efficiency, you've got other issues ;)
1272546921: <tinfoil> heheh
1272546929: <tinfoil> If you can afford that many servers....
1272546954: <dp> I'm trying to see if we could use mongo internally, as a replacement for mysql
1272546995: <dp> especially since we're looking at multi-master replication
1272547048: <tinfoil> document oriented db's don't replace rdbms - you have to think differently
1272547060: <dp> oh but they can, from what I'm reading
1272547321: <tinfoil> oh embeded documents
1272547322: <tinfoil> nice
1272547336: <dp> that's where the relational portion works, afaict
1272547348: <tinfoil> Damn you dp
1272547352: <tinfoil> you make me use my brain :-)
1272547366: <dp> hehe
1272547377: <tinfoil> I stopped writing any code like 2 years ago :-\
1272547385: <dp> time to write some more! :)
1272547385: <tinfoil> been itching
1272547395: <tinfoil> I need to come up with a portfolio
1272547404: <tinfoil> (photography)
1272547412: <tinfoil> so need to dust off html
1272547427: <tinfoil> At minimum
1272547430: <dp> or you could use gallery
1272547444: <dp> http://www.dp.cx/gallery/
1272547448: <tinfoil> yeah
1272547459: <dp> then you need CSS to sexxah it up
1272547517: <tinfoil> Wow, that looks a lot different than the previous versions of gallery I've used
1272547557: <dp> that's g3
1272547561: <tinfoil> I see
1272547614: <tinfoil> I have an idea for my navigation, though it's going to be a little image heavier than I'm used to
1272547660: <tinfoil> I want to base it on depth of field - each menu item on a different focal plane
1272547673: <dp> interesting
1272547691: <tinfoil> mousing over is like a lens focusing
1272547697: <tinfoil> of course, it affects all items
1272547709: <dp> that wouldn't be too terribly difficult
1272547713: <dp> though
1272547713: <tinfoil> no
1272547716: <tinfoil> just image heavy
1272547722: <dp> support in older browsers may be tricky
1272547731: <dp> actually, css3 can do some of that stuff ;)
1272547738: <tinfoil> Yeah 
1272547749: <tinfoil> so can flash
1272547752: <tinfoil> and silverlight
1272547777: <tinfoil> I was thinking using a large overall image and cssv2
1272547795: <tinfoil> so changing one background element position
1272547802: <tinfoil> depending on where the mouse calls
1272547803: <tinfoil> falls
1272547806: <dp> you could do that too
1272547812: <tinfoil> I remember cssplay doing something like that
1272547866: <tinfoil> but also want to do something silly
1272547892: <tinfoil> Print up the menu items, put them on posts at different distances and photograph them
1272548201: <tinfoil> As one image
1272548202: <tinfoil> :-)
1272549452: <tinfoil> Wow... I read something yesterday in my RSS reader and now I can't find it
1272549492: <dp> google reader!
1272549557: <dp> man... compiling gentoo packages on a p3 is painful
1272550447: <TeleCon> I ran gentoo on a Athlon laptop 
1272550462: <dp> this is a 667, with 256M of RAM
1272550467: <dp> this box *sucks*
1272550476: <TeleCon> Oh, this was much better than that, iirc
1272550489: <TeleCon> 1.2/1 maybe
1272550523: <TeleCon> That was 3 laptops ago.  Can't be sure.
1272550740: <tinfoil> dp:  Yes, google reader
1272550766: <dp> tinfoil: search
1272550770: <tinfoil> dp:  I did
1272550774: <tinfoil> dp:  Wrong keywords ;-)
1272550775: <dp> what was it about?
1272550783: <dp> we might have the same feeds
1272550791: <tinfoil> diyphotography?
1272550800: <dp> in that case ;)
1272550810: <tinfoil> All my feeds are photography and seattle realestate
1272550830: <tinfoil> that's actually a very cool website for gadget heads
1272550833: <tinfoil> and diyers
1272551150: <tinfoil> The nice thing about photography blogs compared to tech blogs?  Better signal to noise ratio :-)
1272551170: <tinfoil> More pictures too, so I don't have to read as much ;-)
1272551373: <dp> heh... I've got 251 podcasts in the backlog
1272551390: <dp> tinfoil: you should check out the Stuff You Missed in History podcast... pretty interesting stuff

1272551869: * tinfoil is joking
1272552079: <]3d0g> was that @ me?
1272552114: <dp> no, me
1272552127: <dp> I suggested he check out the Stuff You Missed in History podcast
1272552136: <tinfoil> Will add it to my list :-)
1272552144: <dp> have you used gPodder?
1272552145: <]3d0g> sounds fun. is it short?
1272552155: <dp> ~20-25 minutes per session
1272552198: <]3d0g> link
1272552215: <dp> http://www.howstuffworks.com/podcasts/stuff-you-missed-in-history-class.rss
1272552240: <]3d0g> cool
1272552251: <dp> easy on the ears too
1272552259: * ]3d0g was on yesterday's Basic Brewing podcast.
1272552331: <tinfoil> Oh?
1272552358: <]3d0g> http://www.basicbrewing.com/index.php?page=radio
1272554956: <dp> I lied... only 238 podcasts left to catch me up
1272554975: <dp> that's just since the beginning of the year
1272555279: <]3d0g> I'm always 2-3 weeks behind.
1272555391: <dp> Dan Carlin's podcasts are interesting as well
1272559893: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: A message for you: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rEsqZ6jZrc
1272560097: <]3d0g> the sad thing is, they actually talked to kids intelligently back then.
1272560344: <acr0nym> Please, why would anyone talk to anyone else intelligently now?
1272560462: <tinfoil> That would imply they spoke intelligently to anyone, let along kids.
1272560477: <tinfoil> what acr0nym said.
1272560516: <TeleCon> I tried to listen to one podcast, and couldn't because it was soo overcompressed.
1272560541: <]3d0g> just unfortunate that communicating to kids today requires an animated sponge living at the bottom of the sea or some asshat in a fursuit. 
1272560550: <tinfoil> TeleCon: which potcast?
1272560562: <acr0nym> Huh?  I thought the asshat in a fursuit was for something COMPLETELY different.
1272560576: <TeleCon> AndroidGuys
1272560598: <tinfoil> ]3d0g: I love how people gave the book "enders game" a hard time because kids could never be that complex and intelligent.  
1272560635: <]3d0g> exactly
1272560865: <tinfoil> Of course, I assume those same people never were put in a place where they had to have a serious conversation with a child
1272560875: <tinfoil> let along a gifted child
1272560883: <tinfoil> alone not along
1272560949: <tinfoil> The problem with getting to work at 6am is that I'm ready for lunch by 10:00
1272561215: <TeleCon> Wow.  Lucasfilms trademarked "Droid".
1272561225: <acr0nym> Yeah, you're just noticing that now?
1272561230: <TeleCon> Yeah
1272561231: <acr0nym> All the billboards have that line.
1272561238: <acr0nym> "Droid is a trademark of LFL."'
1272561239: <acr0nym> Heh.
1272561243: <TeleCon> Fineprint at the end of the incredible commercial.
1272561303: <TeleCon> www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Gesai5WlE&feature=player_embedded
1272561312: <TeleCon> Good to see that JEJ can still get work.
1272561805: <acr0nym> Does he have to, do you think?  Heh.
1272561834: <acr0nym> That's interesting.  It means Verizon is using the "Droid" name.  I figgered it was Motorola.
1272561871: <acr0nym> Hah!  Interesting the add mentions the 1GHZ snapdragon, since the Incredible is limiting it to 700mhz.
1272561875: <acr0nym> ad, even.
1272561958: <TeleCon> I'm personally not interested in Verizon anyway.  The MyTouch Slide might be interesting though.
1272561972: <TeleCon> Plus, android 2.1 is about to drop on the g1 cyanogen.
1272562078: <dp> woot
1272562083: <dp> bought me a new video card
1272562183: <dp> gonna get some CUDA love on the distributed computing projects

1272568269: <TeleCon> New ubuntu came out today.
1272568276: <dp> yep
1272568286: <dp> I've been running lucid for a month or two now
1272568289: <dp> pretty stable
1272568321: <TeleCon> I had some issues with 64bit version on one of my laptops.
1272568329: <TeleCon> So I reinstalled.
1272568349: <dp> the only issue I've had with 64bit (which is unrelated to ubuntu) is spotty Flash support
1272568403: <TeleCon> 64bit flash on linux is one of the worst things I've ever seen.
1272568489: <dp> agreed
1272568502: <dp> I don't understand what it is that's so different from the 32bit counterpart
1272568676: <TeleCon> I still have some issues on the 32bit version.
1272568701: <TeleCon> Oh, I know, actually.  The 64bit version is a hack to get the 32bit version kind of working under 64bit.

1272648769: <dp> I said sure, go for it
1272648773: <milkchan> hah cool
1272648785: <dp> I'm trying to get to ~50 users
1272648798: <dp> this is actually the most people that have been simultaneously connected
1272648822: <milkchan> cool.  if you need a spillover or failover server let me know.  my linode doesn't do jack really
1272648876: <dp> cool
1272651446: <fbx> jamie zawinski, from years ago:
1272651448: <fbx>        Whenever a programmer thinks, "Hey, skins, what a cool idea", their computer's speakers should create some sort of cock-shaped soundwave and plunge it repeatedly through their skulls. 
1272651452: <fbx> I am fully in support of this proposed audio-cock technology. 
1272651837: <acr0nym> I really hate tickets like this:  "Appears as if the hardware does not support the latest Sunbelt Vipre version 4.0.
1272651841: <acr0nym> "
1272651854: <fbx> wtf?
1272651867: <acr0nym> That's the WHOLE ticket.  And, this is from a person who's been told, more than once, "We are at the mercy of Juniper."
1272651877: <acr0nym> I really wanna close the ticket and just say "Bummer."
1272651877: <fbx> sigh
1272651883: <fbx> lol
1272651884: <fbx> i would
1272651909: <acr0nym> Or, maybe, "Bummer.  Use a mainstream product."
1272651979: <TeleCon> lol
1272651987: <TeleCon> Is it too early to start drinking?
1272651991: <acr0nym> No.
1272651992: <fbx> meh. there are things out there that can and will break or uninstall nortons that can't touch vipre
1272652011: <fbx> i'd rather not have THE mainstream product
1272652025: <acr0nym> Yeah, well, that's fine.  It doesn't change the fact that we have some recommended standards for campus, BECAUSE things like the VPN hardware keep up with it more reliably.
1272652109: <acr0nym> More than anything, I hate a ticket that isn't actually asking for anything.  WTF am I supposed to tell him?  "Douche, you've been told how it works.  It'll prolly support it eventually"?
1272652148: <acr0nym> Or, is it purely informative, despite the fact that he knows we don't give a shit?  If so, it's basically whining.  In a help desk ticket.
1272652187: <fbx> hey, i've never had an issue with AV fucking up VPN. of course, i'm not a complete moron, so...YMMV.
1272652227: <acr0nym> That's not the point.  Our VPN checks for minimum security standards of a client machine.  If it doesn't recognize your AV, you don't get all the features.
1272652243: <fbx> Ah...gotcha
1272652254: <TeleCon> Does it support openvpn or vpnc?
1272652261: <TeleCon> Or is there at least a linux client?
1272652270: <acr0nym> Beats me.  I neither know, nor care.
1272652282: <acr0nym> Because, campus doesn't support a Linux variant.  At all.
1272652305: <fbx> TeleCon: i was going to ask about shrewsoft. oh well. ;)
1272652324: <acr0nym> Also, I am in the middle of filling out a "Sworn Financial Statement" for my divorce, so I am pissy.  ;)
1272652331: <acr0nym> For at least two reasons.  Heh.
1272652339: <fbx> i though you sounded mad. sorry bro.
1272652364: <acr0nym> Well, partially, I'm mad because this customer is just pretty much reliably a repeat douche-nozzle.
1272652383: <fbx> there it is again!
1272652389: <acr0nym> douche-nozzle?
1272652390: <fbx> douche nozzle
1272652391: <fbx> yeah
1272652393: <fbx> lol
1272652395: <acr0nym> Yeah.  It's a good one.
1272652397: <fbx> i like it
1272652403: <fbx> i fully endorse it
1272652422: <acr0nym> Actually, he's loud, so he's more of a "douche Rain Bird".
1272652429: <acr0nym> get THAT image outta yer melon!
1272653605: <acr0nym> Now, here's a bundle of contradiction:
1272653609: <acr0nym> "stupid integrdy, I just turned down the biggest writing job ever because I've got this moral delma. Don't ever call me a sell out"
1272653657: <acr0nym> "Umm, maybe you should turn it down BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WRITE."
1272655006: <fbx> i'm sorry
1272655030: <fbx> what are "integrdy" and delma"?
1272655056: <fbx> sheesh
1272655084: <fbx> and yes, it took a while to write that because i was unable to misspell them that badly. at least three times.
1272655208: <acr0nym> I'm tellin' ya.
1272655275: <acr0nym> Yaaaay, it's Salisbury Steak day!
1272655437: <]3d0g> ewwww
1272655517: <acr0nym> Eww?
1272655553: * ]3d0g hates horse meat.
1272655576: <acr0nym> No, no, it's ground beef.  It's "Leftover homemade Salisbury Steak Day".
1272655636: <]3d0g> pfft. horse meat.
1272655652: <]3d0g> bad childhood experience
1272655680: <acr0nym> Weird.
1272656027: <TeleCon> Muahahahah
1272656050: <TeleCon> New Conspiracy Theory! Gulf drilling rig explosion was ecotage.
1272656089: <]3d0g> Obama did send extra security to the other rigs.
1272656133: <TeleCon> hmmm
1272656266: <]3d0g> if it *was* terrorism though, some towelhead (or hippie) would be jumping up and down now taking credit.
1272656292: <acr0nym> Unless the hippie organization never thought, "Hey, that might spill millions of gallons of oil into the ocean."
1272656430: <]3d0g> hippies never think past the next dime bag ;-)
1272656435: <TeleCon> Oh now, that was the plan.
1272656457: <TeleCon> Because w/o the oil spill Joe Six-Pack doesn't care.
1272656488: <acr0nym> Huh?
1272656500: <acr0nym> Without a price increase, he doesn't care...
1272656501: <TeleCon> Even better.  A Consiracy between duck huggers and the oil companies to stop off shore drilling and get gas back to $4/gal
1272656512: <TeleCon> Conspiracy
1272656533: <TeleCon> A Lone Gunman blowing up oil rigs does not make a conspiracy.
1272656536: <]3d0g> Meh. They hit a gas pocket. Hazards of drilling. Pure and simple.
1272656540: <fbx> i'm going to nominate the three of you battle to the death over mike's "tinfoil" nick
1272656544: <fbx> sheesh
1272656554: <]3d0g> not me!
1272656559: <fbx> hah!
1272656579: <fbx> where did that theory come from? drudge?
1272656674: <TeleCon> fbx: The dark and paranoid recesses of my mind.
1272656708: <acr0nym> My logic goes, "blow up an oil rig, cost BIG_OIL lotsa money, oops, big spill!  Whoa!"
1272656803: <fbx> yes, because PLANNING an explosion like this is so easy, a hippie could do it (to say nothing of a caveman).
1272656812: <fbx> Really?
1272656814: <fbx> Really?
1272656823: <fbx> srsly?
1272656838: <acr0nym> Hey, I'm not saying I believe any of it.
1272656850: <fbx> It couldn't have been from Halliburton's shoddy work:
1272656851: <fbx> http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703572504575214593564769072.html
1272656878: <fbx> and that's rupert murdoch materiel, not tinfoil leftist website fodder
1272656883: <TeleCon> A tree-hugger with the assistance of some black Exxon paid operative could do it.
1272656907: <TeleCon> fbx: Yeah someone on fb pointed me at that article too.
1272656919: <fbx> One problem: wasn't Exxon and BP may pay through the fucking nose for this one
1272656922: <TeleCon> However, perhaps the shoddy work is only a cover story.
1272656964: <fbx> Hey, anything's possible. I happen to go Occum on this one: it's dangerous, and this is an accident pure and simple.
1272656978: <fbx> s/Occum/Occam
1272657140: <TeleCon> No, No, You must look beyond the truth!
1272657141: <fbx> nice TeleCon 
1272657144: <fbx> hehehe
1272657144: <TeleCon> :)
1272657156: <TeleCon> I'm not saying I believe it.
1272657161: <TeleCon> I'm just putting it out there.
1272657166: <TeleCon> To see if it takes off.
1272657171: <fbx> Like I said, anything's possible. That's some REALLY BAD TIMING indeed.
1272657181: <TeleCon> Becuase you know someone is primed to believe it.
1272657210: <fbx> I'm sure if anything echoes long enough Drudge picks it up, I can find it on Faux News the next day.
1272657227: <TeleCon> Debating if I should blog it at infosyndicate.net and get a whole bunch of people to link to it.
1272657248: <acr0nym> I vote "no".
1272657251: <fbx> Either way, it happened. Which means it can happen. Which means drilling offshore isn't going to pass Congress.
1272657295: <acr0nym> http://prairieweather.typepad.com/big_blue_stem/2010/04/automatic-shut-off-valve.html
1272657408: <TeleCon> The fact that Oil Companies shut down that proposal several years ago just proves that this has been in the planning stages that long.
1272657454: <fbx> money:
1272657455: <fbx> The timing of the cementing in relation to the blast.and the procedure's history of causing problems.point to it as a possible culprit in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, experts said.
1272657460: <fbx> "The initial likely cause of gas coming to the surface had something to do with the cement," said Robert MacKenzie, managing director of energy and natural resources at FBR Capital Markets and a former cementing engineer in the oil industry.
1272657602: <fbx> and i'd like to point out to our dear state's governor that he is, in fact, a moron.
1272657633: <fbx> Bob McDonnell: when a plane crashes, we don't stop flying. by the same token, we shouldn't stop drilling because of one accident.
1272657637: <fbx> right Bob
1272657868: <fbx> plane crash = 400 lives lost
1272657919: <fbx> this spill = the livelihood of thousands of fisherman, tourism folks and god knows what else lost for a generation, not to mention a fuckton of wildlife and habitat
1272657928: <fbx> what an asstard we elected
1272658115: <]3d0g> iPads arrived.
1272658143: <fbx> ]3d0g: "in other news"? ;)
1272658150: <]3d0g> exactly
1272658195: <TeleCon> lol
1272658265: <TeleCon> The fact that ]3d0gs itampon arrived just now, is just to distract us from persuing futher "facts" in the conspiracy.  So is the fact that McDonnell is a moron.
1272658269: <fbx> yeah, i was done with the soapbox. thanks.
1272658283: <fbx> man, it must be friday
1272658291: <TeleCon> Whoa.
1272658301: <TeleCon> That's creepy.
1272658309: <]3d0g> I insist you all remove No Agenda from your podcatchers. NOW.
1272658323: <TeleCon> The fact that it is almost time to start drinking also ties in with distracting us from the truth.
1272658330: <TeleCon> Those Oil Companies are good.
1272658336: <fbx> FUCKERS!
1272658340: <TeleCon> What's no Agenda?
1272658356: <]3d0g> http://noagenda.mevio.com/
1272658394: <TeleCon>  Video Podcasts just piss me off.
1272658402: <]3d0g> basically 2 idiots going on about conspiracy theories. 
1272658429: <TeleCon> If they publish audio only, let me know, I'll add them to Listen, but otherwise, forget it.
1272658440: <TeleCon> I can make up my own conspiracy shit.
1272658453: <TeleCon> No need to watch two tools on a video podcast.
1272658479: <]3d0g> they do
1272658491: <]3d0g> used to anyway
1272658570: <TeleCon> Adam Curry and John Dvorak? WTF?
1272658585: <]3d0g> you didn't know?
1272658614: <TeleCon> No. Never heard of it before.
1272658666: <TeleCon> What the fuck do a former VJ and an asshole pc columnest know about Conspiracies that I couldn't pull out of my ass better>?
1272658688: <]3d0g> that's kinda the point :)
1272658721: <fbx> no one's anal cavity is better at conspiracy theories than yours, TeleCon 
1272659301: <TeleCon> It's kind of neat how you can get in the mindset and make anything part of the conspiracy.
1272659575: <fbx> TeleCon: i gotta ask....what's with the like on Christ Our Savior, Longmont?
1272659588: <fbx> i don't picture you a Jebus freak
1272659615: * fbx may get smacked for that last comment....sorry
1272659693: <TeleCon> Not a jesus freak, per se.
1272659716: <TeleCon> But a seeker, if nothing else, and it's a great source for baby sitters.
1272659725: <fbx> fair enough
1272659764: <TeleCon> Definitely not a right wing wacko xtian, in any case.
1272659772: <TeleCon> Though I can pass for one if needed.
1272659780: <TeleCon> Much more of an anarchist at heart.
1272659781: <fbx> heh
1272659791: <fbx> antichrist? wha?
1272659794: <fbx> ;)
1272659797: <TeleCon> lol.
1272660036: <milkchan> why be an antichrist. that totally locks you into the whole christian framework
1272660038: <milkchan> be more
1272660049: <milkchan> touch boys AND girls
1272660073: <fbx> heh. "Antichrist is too limiting of my evil...I shall become MORE!!"

1272894157: <milkchan> you're installing a mccain?

1272899287: <fbx> bumptop to google
1272899309: <fbx> i predict that becomes part of chromeOS within months if not sooner
1272899895: <dp> had not heard of bumptop before the announcement
1272899932: <fbx> check out the youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqcmPJ-oVL0
1272899949: <fbx> a different way to organize your messy computer desktop
1272900585: <dp> not for linux though :(
1272900643: <TeleCon> yet
1272900689: <dp> the piles idea is neat
1272900698: <dp> wonder if you can have the same file in multiple piles
1272902511: <fbx> not sure...trying to download and it's slow enough that i get about 1/2 the file then the connection dies
1272902563: <fbx> might have something to do with the fact i'm downloading two 80GB AV setups, knoppix 6.2.1 dvd and officd 2010 at the same time
1272902572: <fbx> but they're all working fine
1272902587: <fbx> err....downloading fine
1272903913: <TeleCon> Probably worse than just a /.ing
1272903934: <TeleCon> Imagine, google buys you, that's gotta increase web traffic
1272903973: <fbx> i noticed it on osnews.com
1272903980: <fbx> so it's not like it's hidden
1272904023: <TeleCon> I've gotten 10.8 MB so far, and it is saying 43 minutes left
1272905599: <typofoil> Morning.  :-)
1272905723: <typofoil> Neat, one of my photos from this weekend was broadcast to over 1500 people :-)
1272905726: <typofoil> Nice free promotion
1272905738: <typofoil> Yay twitter
1272905867: <typofoil> http://twitpic.com/1kngv2 [Might be NSFW depending on where you work]
1272905956: <dp> fbx: link me to the file?
1272906046: <dp> nm, got it
1272906058: <dp> can't believe there's not a torrent though
1272906126: <typofoil> Torrent is only for pirated software - because all torrents steal bandwidth from the ISP's *rawr* :-p
1272906129: <dp> ;)
1272906138: <dp> downloading at 900Bps
1272906180: <fbx> typofoil: so you've heard comcast's basic argument in the net neutrality case, then?
1272906214: <fbx> i need a decent name for a new AV server. AV and AVSVR are taken already.
1272906230: <dp> antivirus?
1272906232: <acr0nym> atAVism
1272906243: <dp> or audio video?
1272906269: <fbx> antivirus
1272906300: <fbx> i could go with salus or sulis, but no one knows who they are, so....
1272906300: <dp> TeleCon: is your 10.8 publicly available?
1272906326: <typofoil> fbx: Comcast's vision of the net is like the government taxing you AND your parents when you drive a toll road to visit them.
1272906354: <fbx> typofoil: and having tolls on the backroads to collect even more there if needed
1272906361: <dp> fbx: how about prion? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prions
1272906381: <typofoil> Prion sounds like someone who drives a prius
1272906392: <fbx> prius + moron = prion
1272906396: <fbx> classy
1272906408: <dp> if the shoe fits
1272906411: <fbx> i call them priholes
1272906417: <fbx> more apt
1272906448: <]3d0g> does anyone else notice prius drivers are particularly bad?
1272906466: <]3d0g> I guess being good to the environment allows them some extra douche. 
1272906472: <acr0nym> I can't distinguish anymore between the particularly bad drivers.
1272906490: <typofoil> Minivan drivers are still among the worst

1272906793: <]3d0g> I want a USB stick with a small programmable display on it to label the contents. Tired of doing the stick-swap-dance to find the one I want...
1272906844: <dp> ]3d0g: you could always use masking tape and a sharpie
1272906912: <typofoil> dp: There needs to be a technical solution to the problem - money to be made here!
1272906925: <dp> hehe
1272906940: <]3d0g> We use the rubber corsair ones. nothing sticks to them for crap.

1272910764: <dp> nm, found why
1272910795: <fbx> oops...he was in the constitutional convention, but did NOT sign the constitution. my bad.
1272910816: <fbx> thought that was george mason

1272911238: <dp> milkchan: I've stopped using firefox alltogether
1272911436: <milkchan> adblock extension for it stabilized and is now blocking ads on google.  last i tried it was blocking ads everywhere BUT
1272911443: <milkchan> which i found completely unacceptable
1272911460: <milkchan> got it dumping cookies on exit too, so i'm happy enough
1272911476: <milkchan> you get java plugin working for it?
1272911604: <dp> I'm on 64bit linux, so support for java and flash is flaky enough as it is
1272911651: <milkchan> that's why i'm still running 32 bit even with 12gb o mem on the main box
1272911683: <milkchan> kinda happy ms is forcing the issue with no more 32 bit versions in the future
1272912334: <typofoil> dp:  I'm on 64bit, don't have any issues with flash
1272912349: <typofoil> java?  I don't install it as a matter of policy (and security)
1272912895: <dp> typofoil: you're the luckiest man alive
1272913188: <milkchan> ugh.  united, one of the worst airlines is taking over continental
1272913445: <fbx> how can you get away with not installing java? seriously.
1272913466: <fbx> do you just have VMs that run java?
1272913961: <fbx> i love eliminating bing as an alternative in IE8 search
1272915188: <typofoil> dp:  how do you mean?
1272915358: <dp> typofoil: *everyone* I've seen on 64b linux has flash problems
1272915553: <TeleCon> Not recognizing mouse clicks is the flash issue I notice the most.
1272915874: <dp> jumpy flash is what I notice the most
1272915890: <dp> some flash videos will repeatedly "bounce" to the beginning, over and over
1272916163: <TeleCon> I can't seem to do HD in 64b ubunutu. At least not 1024p 720p works though.
1272916166: <fbx> how's html5 in 64bit?
1272916186: <TeleCon> I'd have to check.
1272916325: <TeleCon> http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody seems to work flawlessly
1272918191: <typofoil> TeleCon: Oh, I might not beable to do HD well either, but admit my DSL is funky due to distance from the CO - Always atributed video skipping in HD to bandwidth (lack thereof)
1272919209: <TeleCon> Shouldn't have that problem on comcast.
1272919216: <TeleCon> *shouldn't*
1272919279: <dp> grrrrrrrrrrr
1272919284: <dp> mint is really starting to annoy me
1272919412: <TeleCon> I'm starting to wonder if it isn't a bw issue though.
1272919424: <TeleCon> html5 and flash both seem to have issues.
1272919700: <fbx> mint = intuit
1272919703: <fbx> get out while you can
1272919747: <fbx> i realize the need to monetize ideas on the interwebs, if only to pay for the bandwidth and servers
1272919767: <fbx> why the fuck has almost no one ever done this gracefully without becoming true pricks?
1272919912: <typofoil> If you ask for money, someone, somewhere, considers you a prick.
1272919963: <fbx> maybe

1272920047: <TeleCon> Hm
1272920062: <TeleCon> Odd part is that it is all working worse under windows than linux.

1272982788: <milkchan> yes.  i say that with contempt.  i'm sure she does a wonderful job the hour or so a week it takes to book conference rooms or travel for a single person
1272983647: <fbx> why, you ask? because you're a sales tech. and that's all you are. or at least that's what she believes.

1272992686: <typofoil> The more serious we become, the more women interested in me
1272992702: <typofoil> ]3d0g: interesting - usually works for me :-\
1272992717: <dp> ]3d0g: are you sure it's barfing on the |, and not the ()?
1272992740: <]3d0g> ls|grep 'EU|US' fails ls|grep 'EU\|US' works.
1272992797: <milkchan> mike: the short girl that works at the deli wants your salami
1272992823: <milkchan> not the asian one
1272992830: <typofoil> milkchan: Not Likely - also she doesn't fit the profile of the ones T and I were talking about
1272992842: <milkchan> dude.  she _seriously_ wants you
1272992878: <typofoil> ]3d0g: can I see the error?
1272992898: <milkchan> to an outside observer, there's a huge difference between generically friendly and omg if he whipped it out right here and now i'd drop to my knees
1272992912: <milkchan> of course the target of this sort of look is uaully blissfully unaware
1272992921: <]3d0g> no error typofoil. just no mach from grep
1272992987: <typofoil> I find using egrep makes more of a difference
1272992997: <]3d0g> try from your documents folder: ls|grep 'xls|doc'
1272993015: <typofoil> $ touch A B C D E F G
1272993016: <typofoil>  $ ls | egrep '(A|E)'
1272993016: <typofoil> A
1272993016: <typofoil> E
1272993029: <]3d0g> egrep works. how about htat
1272993048: <typofoil> grep has a few regex patterns
1272993053: <typofoil> but not many
1272993058: <typofoil> egrep or grep -e has full regex
1272993093: <typofoil> The great thing about UNIX is that none of us know it all :-)
1272993113: <typofoil> Of course, I shell script almost daily
1272993153: <typofoil> It's fun using awk, sed, cut, and perl all in the same script (each have benefits)
1272993166: <]3d0g>  fekkity:
1272993167: <]3d0g>    Basic vs Extended Regular Expressions
1272993167: <]3d0g>        In basic regular expressions the meta-characters ?, +, {, |, (,  and  )
1272993167: <]3d0g>        lose  their  special  meaning; instead use the backslashed versions \?,
1272993167: <]3d0g>        \+, \{, \|, \(, and \).
1272993167: <]3d0g>        Traditional egrep did not support the { meta-character, and some  egrep
1272993167: <]3d0g>        implementations  support \{ instead, so portable scripts should avoid {
1272993167: <]3d0g>        in grep -E patterns and should use [{] to match a literal {.
1272993170: <]3d0g>        GNU grep -E attempts to support traditional usage by assuming that { is
1272993171: <]3d0g>        not   special  if  it  would  be  the  start  of  an  invalid  interval
1272993173: <]3d0g>        specification.  For example, the command grep -E ’{1’ searches for  the
1272993175: <]3d0g>        two-character  string  {1  instead  of  reporting a syntax error in the
1272993177: <]3d0g>        regular expression.  POSIX.2 allows this behavior as an extension,  but
1272993179: <]3d0g>        portable scripts should avoid it.
1272993180: <]3d0g> damn that didn't work well
1272993188: <dp> worked fine
1272993196: <typofoil> Worked fine
1272993231: <]3d0g> so egrep looses { but metas don't have to be escaped. 
1272993248: <]3d0g> someone in unix history needs to be shot in the face.
1272993321: <milkchan> i have to learn subtle .net regex variations now due to the new logging product
1272993333: <milkchan> which is bloody awesome save for only running on windows servers
1272993349: <typofoil> You know what I miss - someone wrote a shell that was based on perl (one of several), but it went abandoned.  The parts I liked is that it worked mostly like a normal shell, but had perl looping/conditionals/variables and inline (piped) regular expressions
1272993365: <milkchan> do any powershell yet?
1272993370: <typofoil> No
1272993391: <typofoil> Most of our windows servers are not on tripwire yet
1272993406: <typofoil> the savvis windows admins are not meeting my expextations of competencey
1272993412: <typofoil> (spelling not included)
1272993416: <milkchan> why is that not surprising
1272993423: <typofoil> The linux admins rock
1272993427: <typofoil> they taught me stuff
1272993437: <typofoil> the windows guys... Argh
1272993467: <typofoil> I asked them to call me next time they deploy a windows machine so we could fix tripwire in the deployment process and not have to touch each machine individually
1272993470: <typofoil> no call
1272993473: <typofoil> they deployed 20 more windows machines
1272993475: <typofoil> idiots
1272993502: <typofoil> I'm going to submit 75 change control requests and put a deadline of like 3 days
1272993512: <typofoil> make them fix all the machine in 3 days
1272993535: <milkchan> that's typical though.  a unix admin uses laziness to achieve efficiency and automation.  a windows admin uses laziness to bill more hours
1272993547: <typofoil> They don't get paid by the hour
1272993549: <typofoil> salary
1272993652: <acr0nym> Huh?  Nine Inch Nails has ended?
1272993699: <milkchan> that wasn't the point.  they can't seem to break out of the log in, point and clickety do something, log out, next
1272993702: <milkchan> mode
1272993734: <milkchan> even if there are tools and methods available, they're intellectually incurious.  the administrative equivalent of sarah palin
1272994389: <fbx> http://bit.ly/aAb2O7  SFW
1272994514: * fbx is intellectually incurious and a windows admin
1272994541: <fbx> and change that shit on your own time...i'm looking to blame you later, not add hours of work for me
1272994582: <typofoil> I'm not an admin
1272994593: <typofoil> I'm also the client
1272994601: <fbx> of the admins?
1272994616: <typofoil> yes
1272994624: <typofoil> Our datacenter is managed :-(
1272994626: * fbx is having a decent devil's advocate day in #
1272994642: <fbx> oh...so they're salaried and under contract?
1272994655: <typofoil> Big datacenter
1272994665: <typofoil> multiple large clients
1272994666: <fbx> good luck getting any extra work or change in process done that isn't explicitly contractual
1272994674: <typofoil> It is explicate
1272994685: <typofoil> We require tripwire
1272994689: <typofoil> it's in the contract :-)
1272994694: <typofoil> They tried to get out of it with networking
1272994714: <fbx> but is it required that tripwire be added during deployment?
1272994740: <typofoil> Yes
1272994758: <typofoil> the hosting company usually hosts tripwire themselves
1272994763: <typofoil> then sells it at $20k/mo
1272994766: <typofoil> to the client
1272994775: <typofoil> we opted to do it ourselves
1272994809: <typofoil> So you see the issue :-)
1272994813: <typofoil> They lost $20k/mo
1272994819: <fbx> so what's broken that requires them to do the big extra step of calling you per deployed box?
1272994827: <typofoil> No
1272994827: <fbx> ;)
1272994839: <typofoil> Calling me one time to see why the installation is broken
1272994869: <fbx> so wait...you're saving them work they can't bill for?
1272994899: <typofoil> They can't bill for it anyway
1272994911: <typofoil> if it's required in the install process and it doesn't work they need to fix it for free
1272994918: <dp> typofoil: do you still have any of those pragmatic programmer books?
1272994943: <fbx> so you're saving them work they could avoid (and thus not have to pay someone on staff for)?
1272994965: <typofoil> typofoil: for ruby? yeah
1272994970: <typofoil> err dp
1272994983: <dp> no, I was hoping for http://www.pragprog.com/titles/bksqla/sql-antipatterns
1272995016: <typofoil> ohhhh
1272995019: <typofoil> that looks cool
1272995042: <dp> no kidding
1272995127: <fbx> dp: you distracted him with a shiny object
1272995131: <dp> hehe
1272998096: <fbx> completely distracted him, looks like
1272998346: <dp> me as well
1272998721: <fbx> i wonder...is there a rule 34 type thing for wikipedia? as in: if you can think of it, wikipedia has an entry of it
1272998804: <dp> probably
1273001730: <dp> yay, merging tables for fun and profit!
1273002691: <dp> just merged two similar tables in to one, replaced the original tables with views on the new table.  removed the need for a UNION query in about 15 places
1273003113: <typofoil> that has to save a lot of time
1273003179: <dp> yes
1273004580: <dp> you know, Transformers wasn't my favorite movie of all time, but it wasn't nearly as bad as everyone suggests
1273005517: <typofoil> It was actually not bad
1273005521: <typofoil> the Sequal, however
1273005543: <typofoil> it's gotta be one of the worst hollywood movies I've ever seen

1273071622: <acr0nym> I'm going with "cocaine-induced seizures".
1273071656: * ]3d0g hazards that at least 1/3 of the people on the road have NO business operating a vehicle. 
1273071687: <acr0nym> Yeah, I tend to agree.
1273071697: <acr0nym> They certainly have no business merging to a highway.
1273072074: * fbx wouldn't mind having driving be less prevalent, with, say, higher barriers to entry via a far more restrictive and harder licensing process
1273072174: <fbx> of course, you'd have to have something else in place (public transit) to the less qualified could go places
1273072186: <fbx> s/to/so/;
1273072193: <fbx> hrm
1273072198: <]3d0g> Except I've got a friend in Germany (where the barriers are very high) and he says it's pretty much Armageddon there too.
1273072200: <fbx> s/to the/so the/;
1273072208: <fbx> really?
1273072211: <fbx> odd
1273072216: <fbx> i've heard the opposite
1273072238: <fbx> although you've got the added fun of no speed limits in certain places in germany
1273072250: <]3d0g> He says it instills excessive confidence and when things go wrong, they go VERY wrong. 
1273072263: <fbx> i guess i could see that, sure
1273072283: <acr0nym> And, let's be honest, it already goes so very wrong here.  Often.
1273072310: <]3d0g> It's time for the next round of technology, IMO. Why the fuck do we need "auto parking" cars? Same tech could be used for simple collision avoidance. 
1273072356: <dp> speed is the issue though
1273072374: <]3d0g> why?
1273072407: <dp> well, simple collision would be at low speeds, so ignore that
1273072437: <]3d0g> I propose that ANY CPU exceeds human brake response by 1000x.
1273073136: <TeleCon> CPU isn't the problem.  Some asshat thinking they can code the avoidance in Ruby is the problem.
1273073203: <]3d0g> But, but, Ruby's on RAILS!
1273073227: <TeleCon> Yeah, and if every vehicle was on rails, we wouldn't have this problemm.

1273084702: <]3d0g> would that be an inner or outer join condom?
1273084718: <typofoil> Depends, who's on top
1273085451: <dp> ugh
1273085460: <dp> I just dropped our primary database
1273085466: <dp> latest backup is from two days ago ;(
1273085470: <dp> oh well, I guess
1273085494: <]3d0g> LOl
1273085496: <]3d0g> sorry
1273085508: <dp> fucking mysql admin tools
1273085549: <]3d0g> I know guis are for sissies but I always use phpmyadmin or phppgadmin
1273085817: <typofoil> there are GUI front ends to mysql?
1273085827: <typofoil> One of the reasons why I liked it is because it's fully functional from the command line
1273085830: <typofoil> as everything should be
1273085900: <typofoil> heh, our exchange is setup with external imaps
1273085902: <typofoil> and authenticating smtps
1273085908: <typofoil> I didn't know that :-)
1273086094: <]3d0g> ANY sql better be damn well fully functional from the command line.
1273086102: <]3d0g> But it's also unforgiving.
1273086140: <]3d0g> at least phpmyadmin gives you a "are you really fucking sure you want to do that stupid thing?"
1273086334: <typofoil> usr mysql ; drop users;
1273086662: * ]3d0g has been dealing with postgres a lot lately. the differences with mysql are enough to make brainhurt.
1273086821: <typofoil> It has a bunch of nice features
1273086845: <]3d0g> postgres?
1273087421: <typofoil> yes
1273087763: <]3d0g> It's rock-stable, which is the only feature I care about. Got a dozen or so dbs in mine and 550 days uptime.
1273087825: <typofoil> 550 days update means you havent patched the system in 550 days
1273087832: <]3d0g> why's that/
1273087834: <]3d0g> ?
1273087840: <typofoil> unless you have redundancy
1273087852: <typofoil> 550 days uptime means, rather
1273087859: <]3d0g> 550 days means I haven't patched the *kernel*
1273087865: <typofoil> true :-)
1273087871: <typofoil> or postgres
1273087875: <typofoil> (potentially)
1273087878: <]3d0g> nope postgres updates fine
1273088220: <typofoil> heh
1273088223: <typofoil> interesting to know
1273088981: <]3d0g> Interesting linux issue. user has a job running as ./bleah >daily.log 2>&1
1273089003: <]3d0g> a tail -f on daily.log quits updating after a few minutes.
1273090044: <typofoil> interesting
1273090057: <typofoil> I've never seen anything like that
1273090130: <acr0nym> Could it be cache?  Is there a flag to make a file not cacheable?
1273090268: <]3d0g> I suspect stdout buffering
1273090889: <dp> why not instead ./bleah 2>&1 | tee daily.log ?
1273090942: <]3d0g> probably don't want the output going to stdout all the time.
1273090992: <]3d0g> huh, I wrote a little script to puke random #s out stdout and with the same setup, tail -f does not go stale.
1273091030: <TeleCon> Is it something stopping and starting? Same PID all the time.
1273091033: <TeleCon> ?
1273091081: <]3d0g> don't think so, but then tail shouldn't care
1273091129: <TeleCon> If the file handle being output to changes, I think that might do it.
1273091174: <]3d0g> how can I send to stderr from bash?
1273091260: <TeleCon> grep da * 2> grep-errors.txt
1273091326: <]3d0g> echo "bleh" >&2
1273091351: <TeleCon>  that's that both stdout and stderr
1273091386: <TeleCon> Oh. hold a sec
1273091514: <TeleCon> Yep, for echo.
1273091653: <]3d0g> fascinating. that broke it
1273091786: <dp> fucking bunch of shit
1273091789: <dp> restored all the tables
1273091803: <dp> now people are asking me "so does that mean that  the work I've done today is gone?"
1273091806: <dp> "yes"
1273091815: <dp> "but what about the things I loaded this morning"
1273091815: <dp> "yes"
1273091827: <]3d0g> Ask them: "were you paid for it?"
1273091831: <dp> what the fuck don't people get about "gone"?
1273092641: <]3d0g> the tail -f weirdness seems to be RHEL5 specific. Fedora and RHEL 4 don't do it.
1273093092: <acr0nym> c:
1273093099: <acr0nym> Heh.  misfire.
1273093111: <]3d0g> get a linux box, looser

1273154204: <fbx> we're a national bank, not a savings and loan
1273154205: <milkchan> you're living in real america therefore you don't have a bank account
1273154228: <fbx> there's a ton of legal difference between the two
1273154257: <fbx> we're actually audited by the OCC, which doesn't have a lot of failed banks on it's audit list

1273154291: <milkchan> real america is huge mkay
1273154449: <fbx> actually, the biggest, coolest thing about our bank is we portfolio ALL our loans

1273154476: <fbx> and we don't loan more than the deposit amounts we have on the books
1273154511: <fbx> so we're not actually making more bullshit fiat money by reselling loans, taking the present value stream of that loan and relending it
1273154522: <fbx> so we're not actually part of the problem

1273154739: <fbx> we've discussed an IT federal CU

1273154761: <fbx> wouldn't be hard with good capital and strong controls
1273154778: <dp> speaking of banks
1273154789: <dp> explain to me why a fucking ACH transfer takes 3 days
1273154862: <fbx> what kind?
1273154871: <fbx> first of all, they don't, but...what kind?
1273154887: <dp> eh?
1273154891: <dp> bank to bank transfer
1273154900: <fbx> like a loan payment or something?
1273154901: <dp> is there any other kind?
1273154904: <fbx> sure
1273154975: <fbx> so a loan payment to bank B from bank A where a deposit account is held?
1273155064: <dp> no, like my account at bank A sending money to my account at bank B
1273155070: <dp> deposit accounts at both
1273155205: <fbx> ok, first it depends on what time of day it's done
1273155275: <fbx> second, i assume this is a "free transfer"...that you're not paying for it (as you're not, say,  a business customer who needs to verify that ACH funds went from a holding account to a payroll account on which many checks will be cashed the next day or something)
1273155295: <dp> correct
1273155327: <fbx> generally, those are bundled together at the sending bank for transmittal to the fed once a day
1273155341: <fbx> the receiving bank will get them that night and process
1273155350: <fbx> the sending bank will receive confirm on day 2
1273155351: <fbx> BUT
1273155388: <fbx> if you miss the transfer for any reason (time diff, file issues, etc), one of those two doesn't happen that day or the next, you get bumped a day
1273155403: <fbx> day 3 is almost always cushion to be sure the service works
1273155408: <fbx> why is that important?
1273155428: <fbx> it costs BOTH BANKS less to do EFT stuff than check presentment
1273155439: <fbx> the fed likes file transfers
1273155471: <fbx> they don't like doing work (check image WITH transfer file)
1273155472: <fbx> ;)

1273155559: <fbx> that's not too terribly bad

1273239277: <milkchan> it's about time someone figured out where all the money was disappearing 
1273239291: <milkchan> bribes, graft, inefficiencies, etc
1273239318: <milkchan> prove that that doesn't exist and then you have the right to talk about raising income/taxes or cutting spending/services

1273245193: --- acr0way is now known as acr0nym
1273245216: <acr0nym> Jeebus FUCK I hate graduation.
1273245266: <]3d0g> graduation WITH ice on 36. It was true carmageddon. 
1273245277: <acr0nym> Yep.
1273245284: <acr0nym> Multiple rollovers by 06:30, apparently.
1273245312: <]3d0g> Makes for a graduation to remember :)
1273245388: <milkchan> ice?  crissakes i'm about to put the airconditioners ON, not in
1273245391: <milkchan> here
1273245416: <]3d0g> Colorado, baby.
1273245432: <milkchan> so ice in the morning and 80 and suny in the afternoon?
1273245444: <milkchan> or is it still all the way winter
1273245492: <]3d0g> naw, we're starting to turn green now. spotty morning snow isn't unheard of into early June
1273245508: <]3d0g> supposed to be uper 70s for mothers day
1273245547: <milkchan> i vote we rename father's day to motherfuckers day
1273245571: <milkchan> that way kids aren't a requirement to celebrate
1273246575: <TeleCon> Whoa, that bad on 36. That sucks.
1273246725: <]3d0g> Kobo hit Borders this morning for pre-order. http://www.borders.com/online/store/MediaView_koboereader
1273247395: <milkchan> drm format?
1273247431: <]3d0g> the kobo reader is source agnostic. It'll work with ePUB, PDF, and Adobe DRM.
1273247470: <milkchan> i guess that was more a question about what borders is going to supply in their book store
1273247491: <milkchan> first major player to go drm free will force everyone else to (hopefully)
1273247575: <]3d0g> Borders is going to use http://kobobooks.com/ for their e-book store. 
1273247601: <]3d0g> I've been reading books off Kobo on my android phone for a couple months now.
1273247615: <]3d0g> And the iPad since it came in
1273247660: <]3d0g> e-books on the phone are perfect for the shitter ;)
1273248378: <milkchan> installed and logged in
1273248493: <]3d0g> ?
1273248603: <milkchan> the app for android
1273248611: <milkchan> just installed it
1273248648: <]3d0g> kobo? cool. They've got a number of free books if you wanna kick the tires.
1273248676: <TeleCon> Works on nook, too
1273248699: <]3d0g> Yup. I quite like their business model.
1273248730: <milkchan> no kindle app for android yet huh?  that will definitely get me to migrate off of the kindle soon
1273248807: <]3d0g> kobo's got new apps coming out for the phones to support bluetooth to their reader as well.
1273248978: * ]3d0g heads off to "read" a little right now :-p
1273249195: <acr0nym> Where's the app that lets me read on a Kindle?
1273249303: <milkchan> that would be called the kindle os, bob
1273249570: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: You're welcome for the xtra dropbox space.  ;)
1273249686: <]3d0g> woot!
1273249706: <acr0nym> So, how much extra does that give me, and, how much am I supposed to start with?
1273249884: <acr0nym> Oh, heh, never mind, 250MB.  Just got the e-mail.  ;)
1273250238: <]3d0g> "invite" your other e-mails for extra space :)
1273250257: <acr0nym> Don't my other e-mails have to accept?
1273250265: <]3d0g> well, yeah
1273250281: <acr0nym> Yeah, that just seems likely to get sorta annoying.
1273250287: <]3d0g> sally and the cats all have dropbox space :)
1273250369: <TeleCon> heh
1273250485: <milkchan> they have a fuse mount for dropbox?  raid your's and the cats et al together ^^
1273250556: <]3d0g> would that be a RAID Cat-5?
1273250620: <milkchan> dunnos.  how many cats have accounts
1273250623: <dp> 256MB, and you should now have 2.25GB
1273250727: * ]3d0g has 5 fur-covered turd-makers.
1273250766: <milkchan> what sort of litter do you use
1273250838: <]3d0g> ugh. that's a story.
1273250859: * milkchan raises an eyebrow
1273250883: <]3d0g> We've got one that's decided to 'wander' from the box. Just switched to http://www.preciouscat.com/attract-litter-p-5.html
1273250898: <]3d0g> shit is $23 a bag!
1273250991: <milkchan> you try http://www.feliway.com/gb yet?
1273251006: <milkchan> that really seemed to settle mine down after the move
1273251172: <]3d0g> yup, we got a couple of the feliway's in the house. hard to say how much they really help with behavior as ours are all so bad to begin with.
1273251221: <]3d0g> when two are part bobcat, there's only so much to be done.
1273251239: <milkchan> oO seriously?
1273251267: <]3d0g> quite seriously. 20lb each. a brother and sister.

1273251293: <dp> in the "Peak Performance" video
1273251293: <milkchan> i didn't know you could cross them
1273251315: <dp> wtf is the sound, that sounds like rubber struggling for grip, that happens *over* and *over* ?
1273251322: <dp> even on dirt
1273251348: <milkchan> i'll assume slipping the clutch
1273251353: <milkchan> can't watch here
1273251364: <dp> sounds fucking *horrid*
1273252372: <]3d0g> that's compressor surge.
1273252393: <]3d0g> racers don't run wastegates. 
1273252604: <dp> meaning?
1273252666: <]3d0g> that horrible sound is the compressor over-revving. wastegates fail too easily so racers don't use them. shortens the life of the compressor but they only expect it to last the race.
1273252758: <dp> ah
1273252849: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: You goin' to defcon this year?
1273252908: <]3d0g> yup
1273252937: <acr0nym> We've gotta get you out some night and introduce you to Delchi.
1273252953: <acr0nym> Getchoo a coin for The Gatherin.

1273253456: <]3d0g> I met Delchi last year, didn't I?
1273253475: <acr0nym> Hrmm.  Mebbe?
1273253491: <acr0nym> Although, if it was IN Vegas, he prolly doesn't remember.  ;)
1273253505: <]3d0g> He did a skytalk, no?
1273253511: <acr0nym> Oh, yeah, the one before me.
1273253533: <]3d0g> yup, definitely met him. chatted for a while
1273253540: <acr0nym> Ah, good, good.
1273253652: <]3d0g> Gathering is invite only. Do I request?
1273253691: <acr0nym> Nah, I'll poke Delchi....
1273253710: <]3d0g> so NOT hawt
1273253745: <acr0nym> Heh.
1273253779: <]3d0g> I should prolly rejoin 303
1273253789: <]3d0g> lurk the pre-DC buzz
1273253801: <]3d0g> TC kicked me for spamming :)
1273253831: <acr0nym> What address, I'll just put it back....
1273253838: <acr0nym> ;)
1273253850: <]3d0g> may as well use the new one - jeff@3d0g.net
1273253903: <acr0nym> Okay, you're back on.
1273253909: <]3d0g> goes straight to the goog servers so no chance of amavis puking again
1273253941: <]3d0g> really should swing red-shift.net e-mail to goog as well. maybe this weekend.
1273254403: <typofoil> Wow, they created a new VM image to create servers from 
1273254412: <dp> finally?
1273254423: <typofoil> Windows 2003 32 bit with IIS installed and Anonymoyus FTP enabled
1273254430: <dp> *awesome*
1273254433: <typofoil> Yeah
1273254437: <dp> can I use some storage? :)
1273254440: <typofoil> Hahaha
1273254453: <typofoil> I just nixed it
1273254631: <typofoil> Dammit, I'm going to start scheduling 5:00 meetings
1273254638: <typofoil> I work 9:30-6:30
1273254646: <typofoil> approved by management
1273254654: <typofoil> and people keep scheduling 8am metings
1273254669: <typofoil> so I end up withing 7:30-6:30
1273254672: <typofoil> working
1273254698: <typofoil> usually because I'm DOING stuff until 6:30

1273268299: <typofoil> surprised they approved it
1273268361: <]3d0g> pilot of caprica!?!?!?
1273268371: <acr0nym> It was the 2hour thing....
1273268375: <acr0nym> You've seen it.
1273268378: <acr0nym> Just not the nipples.
1273268391: <acr0nym> Oh, yeah, you have.  The DVD was the pilot.
1273268413: <]3d0g> no, I'm wondering what typofoil's going on about
1273268710: <typofoil> The pilot for captica was very teenybopperish

1273268859: <typofoil> Actually, this is starting to sound good.  :-)
1273269116: <]3d0g> did you not like battlestar?
1273269505: <typofoil> lOVED IT
1273269508: <typofoil> Loved it
1273269512: <typofoil> well
1273269514: <typofoil> until 3rd season
1273269531: <typofoil> I still enjoyed it after that, but it seemed not very thought out
1273269531: <]3d0g> caprica is like battlestar with 200% less suck.
1273269549: <typofoil> Great, I'll download it once it's canceled :-)

1273269559: <typofoil> or Cable
1273269561: <typofoil> or Dish
1273269565: <]3d0g> so sad, but totally true
1273269568: <acr0nym> Why not download it in process?
1273269759: <typofoil> Well, it's about to be canceled :-)
1273269772: <typofoil> I have about 2-4 hours a week time at home alone
1273269784: <typofoil> so by time I get it downloaded and get time to watch it, it'll likely be canceled
1273269866: <typofoil> In that case, if the browncoats are involved, I might get a chance to see the movie ;-)

1273512537: <typofoil> I won't migrate my work machine to it until I guarentee all my packages are available on it, but home I'll try migrating sooner
1273512538: <dp> stable
1273512553: <typofoil> Nice
1273512557: <dp> I put my work machine on it as soon as it was stable enough to boot fully
1273512560: <dp> it's an LTS
1273512564: <typofoil> LTS?
1273512592: <dp> Long Term Support
1273512604: <typofoil> I just got it on google, too
1273512992: <typofoil> One thing I'm hoping with ubuntu 10 is that gnome allows a little more configuration control without having to hack things
1273512997: <typofoil> somehow I doubt that
1273513005: <typofoil> gnome is turning into what macos used to be
1273513286: <dp> check out lxde/lubuntu
1273513297: <dp> light, configurable
1273515285: <typofoil> Will do
1273515390: <typofoil> sounds like the desktop I built from scratch with gentoo a few years back
1273515395: <typofoil> 100% GTK2
1273515675: <typofoil> Theirs is much nicer
1273515677: <typofoil> better support
1273515688: <typofoil> Mine was a hack
1273515693: <typofoil> though it looked really cool
1273515732: <typofoil> I made all the icons vector based and had anti-aliasing on.  No matter the resolution/icon size everything looked smooth
1273515743: <typofoil> Was a fun experiment

1273522121: <acr0nym> ohh....
1273522123: <acr0nym> umm.
1273522142: <fbx> i'll even say if they'd had better voicing, the movies would have been passable as SW franchise material
1273522148: <acr0nym> Go ahead and explain what the FUCK a midichlorian is, then, we can talk.
1273522175: <fbx> well...WTH else are you going to associate The Force with?
1273522222: <acr0nym> Why do we need to?  Did you ever, once, during the Trilogy, say "Hey, what makes the Force work?"?
1273522291: * fbx pauses, prepared to go on with his side of this brand of "aside from that what did the romans do for us?" argument
1273522308: <fbx> ok, so no one asked before
1273522316: <acr0nym> I'm just saying, it was a whole bunch of explaining that didn't need to happen, yet made things worth.
1273522319: <acr0nym> Worse, I mean.
1273522319: <fbx> and yes, it's not a brilliant answer in the least
1273522323: <acr0nym> I mean, they BROKE the myth.
1273522349: <acr0nym> Taking it from myth to shitty inexplicable pseudo-science was bad, bad, bad.
1273522380: <fbx> ok, but besides the voicing of boss nass and jar jar binks, and the whole midichlorians issue, it wasn't a bad flick
1273522402: <acr0nym> Heh.  Except that it BROKE THE WHOLE MYTH OF ALL THE MOVIES.
1273522405: <fbx> no backstory on darth maul, but he's fun, no?
1273522416: <fbx> *sigh*
1273522423: <acr0nym> Heh.
1273522436: <acr0nym> Dude, you are talking to the WRONG guy about Episode I.
1273522457: <acr0nym> My favorite job EVAR.  Killed by that movie.
1273522469: <fbx> ok, so besides the voicing of nass and binks, midichlorians and breaking the myth on a pseudoscientific onyx, it wasn't that bad, right?
1273522547: <fbx> what job did you have that was killed by tPM?
1273522569: <acr0nym> Manager and administrator of the network for the Star Wars and Star Trek Fan Club.
1273522586: <acr0nym> Who was also the e-commerce fulfillment for both LFL and Paramount.
1273522601: <fbx> well fuck
1273522604: <fbx> sorry about that then
1273522616: * fbx looks about himself at the minefield he's in now
1273522619: <acr0nym> Heh.
1273522624: <fbx> catch a heli out?
1273522651: <fbx> catch your share of shit over lucas' choice there, eh?
1273522655: <acr0nym> Ah, strictly speaking, it was ALSO lousy business practices by the President and VP of the company, but Episode I started the ball rolling very badly.
1273522672: <acr0nym> Oh, yeah.
1273522745: <fbx> ok, so...what if i said it would have been better to have the force be this vaguely inherited property of the brain - like, say, musical acuity - instead of midichlorians
1273522773: <typofoil> acr0nym: how, in your opinion, did they break the muth?
1273522774: <typofoil> myth
1273522777: <fbx> if we pretend that's the basis, then we're down to the voicing of binks and nass, right? ;)
1273522795: * fbx isn't in it to win it
1273522798: <acr0nym> typofoil: It was a mythical force.  Darth Vader was a member of a dark religion....
1273522890: <]3d0g> Catholicism.
1273522925: <acr0nym> typofoil: By the way, which one don't you acknowledge of the first trilogy?
1273522926: <fbx> ]3d0g: i was gonna go for southern baptist, but ok
1273523025: <ouiji> isn't midichlorian something plants make from sunlight?
1273523033: <acr0nym> Umm.
1273523040: <acr0nym> No, I believe you're thinking of chlorphyll.
1273523103: <acr0nym> chlorophyll, even.
1273523146: <]3d0g> Well, there *was* a green jedi, if I recall...
1273523175: <acr0nym> "Hand me my lightsabre.  It's the one that says 'Bad Motherfucker!'"
1273523183: <fbx> mitichondria + chloroplasts = midichlorians!
1273523216: <ouiji> Ureka~!
1273523240: <]3d0g> On the season finale of Amazing Race last night, they had to go through a VR thing at Lucas in SF. Was cool.
1273523265: <fbx> DVR'd it...no spoilers plz
1273523285: <fbx> the wife and i watch it the next sunday with our daughter, who loves that show
1273523301: <]3d0g> yeah, it's a longtime fave of ours.
1273523609: <fbx> Midi-chlorians have had some negative reception amongst fans; some see them as adding hard science to the alleged "mysteriousness" or spirituality of the Force and dislike what they see as a new concept. Others, however, believe that having a physical aspect to a mystical Force calls upon real-world religious traditions, feeling that the mythic qualities of the Force have been strengthened by midi-chlorians. A misconception exists that rather than being indicators,

1273523896: <fbx> wow...that's two reasons to hate the midichlorian thing then ;)

1273605519: <acr0nym> Yeah, you mentioned.
1273605525: <acr0nym> You think metal detector at client site.
1273606105: <milkchan> so in the lovely saga that is dual band clearwire in pre-launch-ish not quite ready for primetime: 1. you can't order a dual band modem unless you fake their site into thinking you're in their 4g coverage area.  2. they use UPS which is staffed by morons.  they dropped the original at the wrong address, a business receptionist signed for it.  obviously i don't have a receptionist at mah house on staff
1273606125: <milkchan> 3. they sent a new one.  UPS, duely chastised, delivered the original one AND the new one the next day
1273606133: <milkchan> i kept the original, used the new
1273606150: <milkchan> you can't actually REGISTER your dual band modem unless you're in the 4g footprint first
1273606207: <milkchan> and when you do go to register, it has to be with their winders only software.  works in a vm, but still...
1273606232: <milkchan> once you do all that, then with the winders only software, you can re-register in a 3g band next time you're in one
1273606254: <milkchan> if you need a new modem, you have to repeat all that registration bs and method again

1273682393: <]3d0g> telecon: 2.1 on G1?
1273682421: <TeleCon> Yeah, I did that a while ago.
1273682433: <]3d0g> I know. Any regrets?
1273682436: <TeleCon> Nope
1273682444: <]3d0g> Allrighty...
1273682454: <acr0nym> strictly speaking, you don't use the G1 heavily as a phone anymore, do you?
1273682462: <TeleCon> It's not as snappynope
1273682476: <TeleCon> It's not as snappy as the n1, but workable.

1273684981: <]3d0g> Still sporting my IBM clicky with nipple
1273685036: <dp> there needs to be more keyboards with USB ports built in
1273685046: <dp> this Dell that I'm using is one of the few that do
1273685065: <]3d0g> ever seen any compatibility issues?
1273685091: <]3d0g> The mrs' computer is dell and many devices refuse to work off the keyboard ports.
1273685095: <dp> only a couple, like plugging in an ipod to it, and the keyboard doesn't give enough juice to use
1273685233: <]3d0g> I'm hating these CM-5 directions already...
1273685257: <dp> wait... AOL owns Engadget?
1273685696: <acr0nym> Looks like.
1273686108: <dp> wonder when that happened
1273687716: <fbx> they bought weblogs in 2005, right?
1273687848: <fbx> i think of all the education that i missed...but then, my homework was never quite like this...
1273687889: <dp> got it made, got it made, got it made, I'm hot for teacher
1273687896: <dp> whew... I had to dig deep for that one
1273687908: <fbx> hehe
1273687933: <fbx> one of van halen's best tunes, iirc
1273687944: <fbx> er...imho that is
1273688267: <acr0nym> Speaking of Hot for Teacher.... Go see if you can see any pics of "Melanie Mitchell", who's a friend of mine on Facebook....
1273688418: <fbx> by virtue of being your friend, i can invade her privacy just fine
1273688422: <fbx> she's preeety
1273688616: <milkchan> anyone know how a machine will react if it has multiple default route entries of the same weight or metric?  does the OS round robin, use one until it can't anymore and then fail over or what
1273688681: <acr0nym> fbx: Yeah.  Hot for teacher, indeed.
1273688694: <typofoil> Not my type.. :-)
1273688708: <acr0nym> Caucasian?
1273688708: <typofoil> milkchan: I think it's first hit in that case
1273688709: <acr0nym> Heh.
1273688717: <typofoil> acr0nym: You've seen tracy, right?
1273688726: <fbx> milkchan: winders or something else?
1273688728: <acr0nym> Yeah, it was a joke.  Sheesh.
1273688733: <milkchan> hpux
1273688749: <fbx> ah
1273688750: <fbx> nm then
1273688753: <milkchan> the admins here are a bit dodgy
1273688755: <typofoil> acr0nym: She uses skis, can't have that
1273688809: <milkchan> i said i didn't think you should ever have multiple default routes but that it wasn't much of an issue if we just add a host route (/32) to the machine we need and force it out the right ip
1273688849: <milkchan> and they balked worried that this would break something.  
1273688887: <milkchan> telling them it would break any non tripwire app that needed to talk to the tripwire host (our /32) didn't work
1273688900: <milkchan> doing the sarcasm doesn't go over well with the doing the needful crew
1273688996: <milkchan> aw ma you know i'm not like the other guys.  i'm nervous and my socks are too loose
1273689528: <milkchan> oh too funny.  networking said they tried to "edjumakate" the unix group re: this issue and failed.  so now networking just adds every possible source ip address the unix group uses to their firewall rules
1273689571: <milkchan> "we should know what the source ip addy is but oh well"
1273690395: <fbx> typofoil: she uses skis is your break point? wtf?
1273691113: <typofoil> she doesn't snowboard
1273693306: <TeleCon> two sticks vs one stick strapped to feet to get down a mountain? That shouldn't be a deal breaker.
1273693397: <acr0nym> It's sorta "like a jeep thing" I think....
1273693434: <TeleCon> Oh. I see.
1273694511: <fbx> ok, splain that, Lucy
1273694595: <acr0nym> Just one (actually 2) of those ridiculous divisions I don't much understand.
1273694726: <fbx> Still not groking. Sorry.
1273694817: <TeleCon> Skiiers vs Snowboarders.
1273694822: <TeleCon> "It's a jeep thing"
1273694843: <fbx> as in one group has jeeps and the other doesn't?
1273694855: <fbx> or one uses their jeeps and the other just drives them?
1273694867: * fbx is feeling thick about now
1273694955: <TeleCon> ridiculous artificial divisions.
1273694969: <fbx> maybe that's why i'm not getting it
1273694980: <fbx> arbitrary much?
1273694981: <TeleCon> Acronym and I don't get them.
1273694989: <TeleCon> Which is what we were saying.
1273695043: <TeleCon> To me, skiiers and snowboarders are both people who strap shit to their feet to get down a mountain.
1273695131: <typofoil> It was random and arbitrary
1273695195: <typofoil> I haven't snowboarded in 2 years
1273695213: <TeleCon> I believe mountains should be descended by parachute
1273695756: <acr0nym> Also, lots of Jeeps here have tire covers that say "It's a Jeep thing, you wouldn't understand".
1273695807: <acr0nym> And, it's true, I don't.

1273843038: <acr0nym> Yes, I am, but, badly.
1273843042: <acr0nym> Something was broken.
1273843042: <dp> eh?
1273843045: <dp> hehe
1273843054: <acr0nym> Both dp.cx and mymiler.com were using the same db file.  Oops.
1273843062: <acr0nym> NOW, it's separate files.
1273843065: <dp> ok
1273843087: <dp> wonder how long its been that way
1273843099: <dp> because I can't dig @8.8.8.8 dp.cx
1273843109: <dp> but it started happening earlier this week
1273843130: <dp> woah

1273843154: <milkchan> a corpse not in rigor = party
1273843165: <acr0nym> Expired for a year?
1273843173: <acr0nym> Or, a db fuckup on the registrar?
1273843189: <dp> I'm fairly certain I paid for it...
1273843246: <dp> well, and the registrar site is down...
1273843293: <milkchan> when you support non .com registrations, you're supporting terrorism!
1273843406: <dp> huh
1273843413: <dp> guess they never sent me a renewal request
1273843487: <dp> wierd
1273843494: <dp> wonder if I can transfer it to dotster
1273844452: <dp> nope, they don't transfer .cx
1273847814: <milkchan> massive downpour here
1273849568: <dp> massive headache here
1273849584: <dp> I've cut out the caffiene, and it's painful
1273849652: <acr0nym> Sounds risky.
1273849659: <dp> it is
1273849665: <dp> headaches, sleepy, etc
1273851589: <dp> ok, here's a random question
1273851597: <dp> just audio, and it was paused
1273851602: <dp> shit, one sec
1273851625: <dp> http://bit.ly/daiKXc -- thoughts on something like *this* being the "end of the world" in 2012?\
1273855206: <milkchan> nah.  that does cause revolutions though
1273855273: <milkchan> tzarist russia was a good example.  the rich don't run out of money, the people run out of money or any resource really and can no longer be fleeced by the rich.  that's what causes system collapse that leads to revolution
1273855338: <milkchan> wealth/resource imbalance is the classic parasitic arrangement.  when the parasite does its job too well, both the host and the parasite die
1273855578: <typofoil> what about it would cause revolutions?  The article was cut off mid way through
1273855693: <TeleCon> Hm
1273855707: <TeleCon> Google will stop selling n1 online, and move to retail channels.
1273856079: <milkchan> it was a huge leap of faith to order a phone without touching a model first
1273857188: <typofoil> Google is the latest religion
1273857212: <typofoil> Forced myself to start working in ruby again last night
1273857223: <typofoil> fell back to perl and forgot ruby
1273857226: <TeleCon> I'm considering a mytouch slide, to improve 3g perf.
1273857249: <typofoil> Why does that sound perverted?
1273857531: <TeleCon> Because that is the way you think.
1273858152: <milkchan> heh finally sanitized my liverwur.st nic info - not that anything but my name was correct

1273861628: <]3d0g> google officially dropped the nexus one today. giving it over to retail, if they want it.

1273861787: <typofoil> That's weird
1273861835: <typofoil> You know, photography blogs seem to be much more focused than most tech blogs
1273861846: <typofoil> Much, MUCH, better signal to noise ratio
1273861893: <dp> agreed
1273862078: <typofoil> dp:  agreed on which point?
1273864386: <dp> s2n
1273864394: <dp> I need a do not disturb sign for work
1273864424: <]3d0g> I'd opt for "I am disturbed" instead.
1273864563: <dp> ;)
1273866197: <typofoil> Accurate, too!
1273867040: <dp> ok, domain is "fixed" as of now
1273867045: <dp> still suspended in whois
1273867142: <dp> actually, expired last month, still
1273867935: <]3d0g> this morning it showed it expired in 2009
1273867972: <]3d0g> they must be REALLY slack on Christmas Island.
1273868048: <dp> Expires: 23 Apr 2010
1273868058: <dp> hrm, still suspended though
1273868067: <dp> bet I have to renew for another year to get it the rest of the way
1273868070: <]3d0g> was 2009 this morning when I checked
1273868074: <]3d0g> same day though
1273868136: <dp> yeah
1273868209: <dp> had that fscking domain for 8 years
1273869394: <fbx> dp.cx?
1273869927: <dp> yes
1273869933: <dp> currently suspended ;)
1273870896: <]3d0g> which is why I couldn't join the # this morning
1273870987: <dp> yep
1273870999: <dp> you could just use screen + irssi ;)
1273871004: <dp> like the rest of us
1273871191: <TeleCon> that'd be too easy
1273871374: <]3d0g> that would be another window on an already crowded desktop
1273871390: <]3d0g> I like having everything in pidgin
1273871772: <typofoil> pidgin?  people still use that?
1273871835: <]3d0g> yup
1273871839: <]3d0g> proudly too
1273871856: <]3d0g> some of us are comfortable in our GUIness
1273872419: <typofoil> I thought empathy was the new pidgin?
1273872517: <]3d0g> I ain't tried it yet
1273872578: <]3d0g> Woah. TiVo's judgment against DirecTV got vacated. 
1273872583: <]3d0g> Good for me!
1273872630: <TeleCon> Empathy was the replacement for pdgin on ubuntu.
1273872634: <TeleCon> I wasn't happy
1273872838: <typofoil> I like some of what it has to offer
1273872842: <typofoil> but generally yes, I agree
1273872846: <typofoil> I still prefer bitlbee
1273872940: <typofoil> bitlbee, screen, irssi

1274370505: <dp> is that all you need?
1274370609: <]3d0g> the actual process of fully deleting a volume involves flushing the alias from multipath, followed by an echo 1 > /sys/block/sdbj/device/delete for each device. I'd love to get that into a single command.
1274370638: <dp> pipe to awk '{if($1=="\\_" && $3!=0) print $3}'
1274370689: <]3d0g> see? dp isn't totally useless :)

1274377070: <TeleCon> d'oh
1274377073: <TeleCon> Heh
1274377100: <acr0nym> I can't believe that "asshatlinux.com" hasn't been taken yet.
1274377115: <TeleCon> Did we let that expire?
1274377124: <acr0nym> Yeah, multiple years ago.
1274377126: <fbx> i do know the guy who used to manufacture dog's ass beer
1274377129: <fbx> does that count?
1274377129: <acr0nym> Should we get it back?
1274377130: <TeleCon> Hmmm
1274377131: <typofoil> Someone needs to come up with a generic religious locality framework so we can make a cross religious operating system more easily.
1274377151: <dp> ooh
1274377157: <dp> lart.com seems to be available
1274377170: <acr0nym> No it doesn't....

1274377202: <typofoil> I always do "whois" to check domain availability
1274377224: <dp> that involves opening another screen window, and then parsing whois
1274377235: <dp> I just want a command that says "Yes" or "No"
1274377246: <typofoil> also because some sites where you can check availability have a tendency to buy the domain if you don't (if it's deemed worth money)
1274377249: <acr0nym> Yeah, but, THIS is the guarantee of availability: "No match for "ASSHATLINUX.COM"."
1274377260: <dp> guess I could just grep
1274377279: <typofoil> dp:  if you get results from whois, the domain isn't available  :-)
1274377286: <typofoil> not hard to parse
1274377306: <dp> typofoil: my whois spits out a shit-ton of extra stuff
1274377353: <typofoil> downloading ubuntustudio, going to give it a try
1274377387: <acr0nym> You're doing music, now, too?
1274377392: <acr0nym> Isn't one hobby enough?
1274377405: <milkchan> what's a hobby?
1274377432: <acr0nym> Oh, I guess it does say "graphic enthusiast", too.
1274377506: <typofoil> acr0nym:  Also, been playing with HD video on my DSLR
1274377512: <typofoil> so I need audio and video too
1274377519: <acr0nym> Ah.
1274377526: <typofoil> still no cinepaint, but I'll install that
1274377536: <typofoil> (compile by hand, wonderful)
1274377675: <dp> wtf is CinePaint?
1274377720: <typofoil> a fork of gimp created by the movie industry a while back - originally called film gimp.  Less features, but more color depth
1274377737: <typofoil> My camera takes 14bit per color images
1274377760: <typofoil> but to do anything more than basic touchup in bibble, I need to reduce the colors to 8bit so I can edit in gimp
1274377798: <typofoil> And as much as I claimed it wasn't a big deal, it does make a noticable difference
1274377805: <typofoil> espeically if you print
1274377870: <dp> shit... I've got too many windows open
1274378056: <milkchan> Google said that it collects SSID information as well as the MAC addresses of WiFi routers it encounters along the Street View route -- ahhh this is why lattitude picked up on my location even though i had turned off my phone
1274378066: <milkchan> while in amsterdam i mean
1274378084: <dp> they said that the collection of wifi packets was accidental
1274378144: <typofoil> I doubt that.
1274378186: <milkchan> what i pasted is what they DO collect intentionally
1274378215: <milkchan> unencrypted packet payloads was what they said was an accident
1274378245: <typofoil> Hey, if you stand naked in front of your window, it's not a violation of privacy if I'm walking down the street and see you
1274378246: <milkchan> which honestly is just as accessable as mac and broadcasted ssid to anyone bothering to look
1274378264: <typofoil> If you take no steps for privacy, you have no reasonable expectation of privacy
1274378269: <milkchan> some things that are seen cannot unseen
1274378274: * milkchan gouges out his eyes
1274378281: <milkchan> cannot be*
1274378493: <milkchan> http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1653062&cid=32222226  -- holy shit.  someone else knows mount chrissy
1274378500: <milkchan> that's mostly for mike but anyone might enjoy it
1274378690: <typofoil> *twitch*
1274378758: <typofoil> *reboot*
1274378769: <typofoil> What were we talking about?
1274378771: <typofoil> :-)
1274378783: <TeleCon> We have asshatlinux again.
1274378799: <acr0nym> Heh.
1274378817: <acr0nym> ]3d0g, I assume this is your fault? "Hide
1274378819: <acr0nym> Josh Miller likes The Stig."
1274378831: <acr0nym> Oops.  The "Hide" was ann accidental copy.
1274378945: <typofoil> Who doesn't like the Stig?
1274378976: <]3d0g> Seriously.
1274378996: <acr0nym> I'm pretty much indifferent about the Stig.
1274379014: <typofoil> hah, like the google results for "define: stig"  
1274379019: <typofoil> I knew there was slang in there somewhere
1274379055: <typofoil> Love the episodes where the stig is doing something other than driving... like taking the tubes across london
1274379100: <]3d0g> that one was hilarious 
1274379133: <typofoil> I'm surprised they didn't have him in the 50cc car and time him going around the track
1274381491: <acr0nym> Hrmm: http://lifehacker.com/5543720/google-announces-android-22-with-flash-google-tv-at-io-conference
1274382036: <typofoil> Wow, so by next summer I can upgrade to 2.2
1274382053: <typofoil> That is another complaint I have over the iphone
1274382092: <dp> ?
1274382125: <typofoil> Unless you hack your phone, you have to wait for the telco to push the OS to you
1274382161: <typofoil> which means it takes time after google releases it for the phone company to modify 
1274382202: <typofoil> With the iphone you can upgrade when apple releases, not hot have to wait for a push
1274382293: <typofoil> Oh, and update-all button for market place
1274382296: <typofoil> about f'n time
1274382849: <typofoil> Now if googleTV/netflix learn to play well, I'll be impressed
1274384341: <acr0nym> Hah! http://www.woot.com/Blog/ViewEntry.aspx?Id=12837
1274384589: <typofoil> Hahahahaha
1274384592: <typofoil> that is classic
1274384632: <acr0nym> Yeah, it's pretty well done.
1274384646: <dp> someone needs to post instructions for patching gentoo's mysql build with percona/facebook/google/etc patches
1274386197: <dp> oooh... Google purchased Simplify Media
1274387828: <typofoil> Mysql with percona facebook google patches?

1274388893: <]3d0g> dp, I think I'm pissing off your kin and don't even know how
1274389037: <dp> eh?
1274389051: <]3d0g> forwarded you a cryptic message on FB
1274389059: <]3d0g> think its from one of yours
1274389073: <dp> yes
1274389074: <dp> it is
1274389074: <acr0nym> Oooh, let's see it!
1274389080: <dp> link to the comment?
1274389099: <]3d0g> they sent me a PM
1274389106: <dp> meant the "Religion comment"
1274389107: <typofoil> ]3d0g: Want to help piss off mine too?  I got tired of doing it
1274389122: <]3d0g>   Carol Solsberry Fletcher    May 20 at 2:09pm
1274389123: <]3d0g> I'm not trying to offend you or get into a big discussion. I'm also not trying to push my beliefs on you. I know the Religion comment was not directed at me, I just want to respond to it. My life as a Christian is happy, as I'm sure yours is. I hope and believe my happiness will not just be in this life but in the hereafter.
1274389138: <dp> I think it may be time to defriend Aunt Carol
1274389140: <]3d0g> funny thing is, I have no idea what she's going  on about
1274389149: <dp> she's hit a big fucking religious wave in the past couple of years
1274389161: <typofoil> What is this with facebook becoming religious?
1274389163: <acr0nym> Heh, she probably checked out your profile, and saw your little message about delusion.
1274389168: <acr0nym> And, she's just "helping".
1274389184: <]3d0g> ah, could be acr0. 
1274389230: <dp> probably
1274389310: <typofoil> Seriously, I've seen similar ship happening
1274389326: <typofoil> 1/3 of my updates are religious these days
1274389356: <]3d0g> Should I reply "There is no hereafter. This is it, make the best of it."? :-D
1274389358: <typofoil> When easter came it was "Remember the real meaning of easter" day
1274389379: <fbx> blergh
1274389380: <acr0nym> Shoulda posted early on "Happy Zombie Jebus Day".
1274389385: --- fbx is now known as fbx-out
1274389387: <fbx-out> lates
1274389389: <dp> ]3d0g: that'd be funny
1274389390: <]3d0g> ciao
1274389488: <]3d0g> G1 is behaving MUCH better after this morning's changes.
1274389688: <]3d0g> I've had other "friends of friends" send me hatemail. My piss off skills must really be improving.
1274389740: <acr0nym> Heh.  You should see some of the shite my roommate gets into.
1274389752: <]3d0g> matt #2?
1274389968: <typofoil> ]3d0g: what did you say to them?
1274390002: <]3d0g> I'm lazy. I ignore morons.
1274390014: <]3d0g> present company excepted, of course.
1274390052: <typofoil> ]3d0g: So that's why they wrote you?
1274390135: <]3d0g> Oh, one was some rant about a dailykos link I posted. Another went off on a tea party vid I linked off youtube
1274390186: <typofoil> Hah
1274390186: <]3d0g> this one: http://www.3d0g.net/blog/dearconservatives
1274390202: <typofoil> What is this whole teaparty thing anyway
1274390203: <typofoil> ?
1274390250: <]3d0g> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbyFeFhUTmI
1274390271: <]3d0g> that vid STILL cracks me up
1274390298: <typofoil> I'll have to watch it when I go home
1274390299: <]3d0g> Obama's banning FISHING for god's sake!
1274390363: <acr0nym> Huh?
1274390426: <]3d0g> 2:40 in that vid
1274390448: <acr0nym> Just remember, if you're gonna have a lot of teabagging, you need a Dick Armey.
1274390503: <]3d0g> I love how the FOX "teabagging" slip-up has stuck to the Tea Party. 
1274390553: * typofoil snickers
1274390569: <acr0nym> Ah, yeah, there's no way I would have made it through 2:40 of that video....
1274390589: <typofoil> IT sounds a lot like "there is a storm coming" video
1274390605: <]3d0g> it's like a bad car accident. you just can't look away. 
1274390644: <acr0nym> Oh, see, I can.
1274390728: <typofoil> I lack that ability, so I just don't watch any more
1274390749: <typofoil> That actually started when someone sent me a link to someone being beheaded by taliban
1274393474: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
1274396563: <TeleCon> First I'd heard about banning fishing.
1274416637: <-- typofoil has quit (Ping timeout)

1274455594: <typofoil> The google front page logo is a playable version of pacman
1274455740: <]3d0g> that. is. AWESOME.
1274455859: <typofoil> Isn't it?
1274455945: <typofoil> I almost completed the first level on my first try.  Impressed I maintained my pac skills without playing for so long.  :-)
1274456383: <]3d0g> 30 years. God that makes me feel old.
1274456594: <typofoil> Yeah
1274456624: <typofoil> I'm kinda happy they celebrated it though
1274456642: <typofoil> next to pong, it's probably one of the most influencial video games around
1274456657: <typofoil> though pong has it beat by a few years
1274456749: <]3d0g> And I was never a huge fan. I loved Williams games. Defender and Robotron were my all-time favorites.
1274456951: <TeleCon> I'd have to say Atari.
1274456957: <]3d0g> Also was a big fan of all of Atari's vector graphics stuff like Asteroids, Battlezone, and Tempest.
1274456962: <TeleCon> Marble Madness and 720 degrees.
1274456973: <TeleCon> Those are the ones I still ocasionally want to play
1274456977: <typofoil> battlezone
1274456983: <typofoil> wow
1274456983: <]3d0g> Marble Madness. excellent
1274456994: <typofoil> astroids
1274456995: <typofoil> wow :-)
1274457006: <typofoil> I don't remember marble madness
1274457008: <typofoil> hrm
1274457017: <TeleCon> I do remember space ace and dragonquest, too.
1274457022: <TeleCon> But only for novelty.
1274457026: <typofoil> Disney, right?
1274457036: <TeleCon> Um.
1274457038: <TeleCon> don't recall
1274457039: <typofoil> It's a bit later, but gauntlet
1274457046: <typofoil> "Warrier needs food"
1274457049: <TeleCon> Don Bluth was the animator though, iirc
1274457050: <typofoil> that's one I'd own
1274457100: <]3d0g> Defender was the only game I TRULY mastered though. Play as long as I wanted on a quarter.
1274457152: <typofoil> If you could own one full sized arcade game (and not a multi-game system, but a classic arcade game) which would it be?
1274457161: <TeleCon> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Ace 
1274457168: <]3d0g> Easy. Robotron. 
1274457176: <TeleCon> Marble Madness and 720 degrees.
1274457180: <TeleCon> s/and/or/
1274457195: <TeleCon> "SKATE OR DIE"
1274457214: <typofoil> Hehehe
1274457232: <typofoil> I was also fond of spyhunter
1274457260: <]3d0g> VERY interesting for Denverites: http://www.clubworkshop.com
1274457312: <typofoil> hehe
1274457326: <TeleCon> That was fun, but you really don't need the original console to play it.
1274457331: <typofoil> ]3d0g: I swear, you would love some of the people I hang out with out here
1274457343: <]3d0g> where's here?
1274457347: <typofoil> Seattle
1274457359: <typofoil> people like hazzard factory are here
1274457363: <]3d0g> I'd shoot them after too many days of no sunlight.
1274457394: <TeleCon> Does denhac know about that group?
1274457406: <typofoil> There are like 10 such groups here
1274457409: <typofoil> and likely
1274457415: <typofoil> hackbot is here
1274457424: <typofoil> ummm, I can't remember the others off the top of my head
1274457430: <typofoil> Tracy knows people in almost all of them
1274457466: <typofoil> hazzard factory was in a TV show inspired by myth busters for a while
1274457508: <typofoil> the lack of sun in the winter does kinda suck
1274457514: <typofoil> the ammount of sun in the summer is amazing
1274457536: <typofoil> the sun at it's peak is up to like 10pm
1274457649: <typofoil> This is still the coolest city I've lived in
1274457662: <typofoil> Oh yeah, SteamCon 2011 is in active development
1274457680: <typofoil> Last year had better turnout than expected
1274458840: <dp> HOME!
1274460110: <typofoil> Someone needs to invest a device that stabs someone in the face when they leave their celphone with an annoying ringtone at their desk for over an hour.  One stab per ring
1274460117: <typofoil> invest = invent
1274460143: <typofoil> Been listening to Nelson's (simpsons)  
1274460149: <]3d0g> I just take the battery out
1274460150: <typofoil> "Ha ha!" for over an hour now
1274460168: <typofoil> Not a bad idea
1274460494: <]3d0g> even better, hide the battery.
1274460516: <typofoil> I still like the stab in the face idea
1274460556: <typofoil> Someone here had the idea of changing ring tones, but then everyone who didn't already lock their phones started after that point
1274460572: <typofoil> ie - leave your phone at your desk, we change your ring tone to something you don't like
1274461643: <typofoil> Finally replaced noscript with policyrequest
1274461658: <typofoil> sad to say, noscript still has better features, even if it is evil
1274463874: <milkchan> noscript update frequency is evil.  just bind his damn update site where he tries to get page views to pad his ad revenue to loopback
1274463939: <milkchan> tempest, zaxxon or super zaxxon
1274464002: <typofoil> As you told me, he also got caught altering adblock so his ads wouldn't be blocked
1274464022: <milkchan> yes that's the "evil" in it.  he got slapped down hard for that
1274464042: <typofoil> I'm tired of updating after ever time I restart firefox
1274464045: <typofoil> so fuckem
1274464055: <milkchan> he's STILL doing it?
1274464057: <typofoil> I did adblock everything listed on his page
1274464059: <milkchan> the update frequency i mean
1274464064: <typofoil> yes
1274464083: <typofoil> I adblocked EVERY domain mentioned on his page
1274464086: <milkchan> hah.  do adblock whitelists supercede custom block points
1274464098: <typofoil> then blocked the HTML element on every one of those sites too
1274464103: <typofoil> so if you visit, they come up totally blank
1274464114: <typofoil> I think whitelists override
1274464115: <typofoil> yes
1274464115: <milkchan> because that's what he did to adblock - added a whitelist for his own stuff
1274464121: <typofoil> yep
1274464123: <typofoil> he stopped, however
1274464192: <milkchan> i'm thinking of switching to chrome for all legit surfing and using netscape+noscript+adblock just for anything questionable
1274464216: <typofoil> try policyrequest
1274464221: <typofoil> it's almost as good as noscript
1274464241: <typofoil> I do like it's interface too
1274464258: <typofoil> A little evolution, I think it will be up to noscript's level of evolution
1274464299: <typofoil> It does have a nice feature to allow script from a domain only when being requested from the domain your visiting (not anywhere else)
1274464370: <typofoil> "allow requests from visiting.website.com to external.website.com"
1274464399: <typofoil> it allows everything from the same domain as the page you're visiting
1274464551: <typofoil> The one feature I liked in noscript was the ability to blacklist sites so they didn't even show up in the menu
1274467895: <milkchan> gah one or two more hours
1274467900: <milkchan> at least the 4g is nice
1274468044: <typofoil> Looking at a new netbook
1274468048: <typofoil> with wimax and gps
1274468142: <milkchan> i dunno.  i'd rather have the clearspot than something built in to any one device
1274468160: <milkchan> had 2 laptops, the client's laptop and my phone running through it all this week
1274469301: <typofoil> @milkchan - Since I can use multiple devices for free and want a netbook that can fit in my camera bag, it makes sence :-)
1274469312: <typofoil> but otherwise, totally agree
1274472287: <]3d0g> Holy crap. Shit My Dad Says is getting it's own TV show this fall.
1274472317: <]3d0g> Starring William Shatner!
1274472988: <typofoil> What's that?
1274473056: <typofoil> Oh, I see
1274473057: <]3d0g> http://twitter.com/shitmydadsays
1274476365: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
1274476939: <typofoil> So we create a "gold image" of an os which is the template vmware image for new machines
1274476942: <typofoil> I scan it
1274476944: <typofoil> It passed scanning
1274476960: <typofoil> the hosting company then deployed it to everything
1274476966: <typofoil> enabled/installed other applications
1274476982: <typofoil> and about that it had a medium SSL vuln on EVERYTHING
1274476997: <typofoil> So the hosting company is trying to spin it to say I missed that in the scan of the gold image.
1274483093: <TeleCon> Nice thing about that is  you still have the gold image to scan.
1274483316: <typofoil> Yeah
1274483353: <typofoil> What bothers me more is that people don't seem to understand that if you install/change anything it invalidates the scan

1274658252: <milkchan> it doesn't invalidate the scan.  those results are still accurate.  it just requires a new scan, too ^^
1274661931: <milkchan> still no 4g at newark but the 3g is servicable
1274705480: --- fbx-out is now known as fbx
1274707966: <fbx> exciting morning!
1274707991: <fbx> power outage around one office took out local server, network and phones (and ATM)
1274708002: <typofoil> nice
1274708007: <fbx> power's back now, so...ATM's still out though
1274708014: <typofoil> Who needs money?

1274708145: <fbx> dp: you ever get dp.cx back up?
1274708146: <typofoil> populated with a year's worth of content
1274708150: <fbx> nice
1274708154: <fbx> been busy? hehe
1274708206: <typofoil> No, just wrote a program to pull the photo date from EXIF, and then used Tumblr's API to post the pictures, but used their capture date.  Took like 10 minutes
1274708225: <typofoil> surprised even me :-)
1274708300: <milkchan> yay 4g in D.C.
1274708315: <milkchan> just not in this building.  hell.  can't even get a good 3g signal
1274708359: <typofoil> you're in D.C.
1274708366: <fbx> typofoil: nice...automation is fun when you can get it

1274722107: <typofoil> So, was Lost worth it?
1274722344: <typofoil> So bad when I'm at work, and I have to fire up WiMax to get decent transfer speeds, especially when downloading from our own datacenter
1274722360: <typofoil> WiMax+VPN = faster than our internal network
1274722384: <TeleCon> sssh
1274722385: <TeleCon> Hven
1274722385: <TeleCon> t seen it yet, so I dunno
1274722513: <dp> wow
1274722519: * dp hands TeleCon a new keyboard
1274722529: <typofoil> Brought my dell 13" to work to upgrade to ubuntu 10
1274722535: <TeleCon> Nah, I would need new fingers to fix that problem.
1274722555: <dp> typofoil: you might be interested in awesomewm
1274722632: <typofoil> sounds like it was written by someone who used DWM
1274722708: <typofoil> Will check it out at some point.  I was a big fan of DWM, except it didn't support xinerama
1274723413: <typofoil> Kinda feels good to have a website online again, with a years worth of content
1274724090: <acr0nym> Oh.
1274724092: <acr0nym> My.
1274724094: <acr0nym> Gawd.
1274724103: <acr0nym> I truly get the stupidest tickets:
1274724105: <acr0nym> TITLE: Unmanaged Servers - Customer is rebuilding server, would like to know what he needs to do to set up the server- informed customer that he would need a static IP address. Would like to know the DNS mask and other settings needed for server.
1274724128: <acr0nym> I REALLY want to e-mail the doofus and say, "you shoulda written them down first."
1274724137: <-- ouiji has quit (Ping timeout)
1274724139: <acr0nym> I mean, seriously?  Rebuilding?
1274724314: <dp> typofoil: link?
1274724369: <acr0nym> I bet it's sinisterbrain.net
1274724383: <acr0nym> Nope.  I'm wrong.
1274724419: <typofoil> sinisterbrain.com
1274724424: <acr0nym> Yep.  See, wrong.  Heh.
1274724426: <typofoil> :-p
1274724475: <typofoil> DNS Mask?
1274724487: <acr0nym> Yeah, the painful parts are just endless in that one.
1274724505: <acr0nym> I'm just gonna say "240".
1274724506: <typofoil> If you have to ask about a DNS mask, you shouldn't be allowed near a server
1274724509: <acr0nym> See what happens.
1274724531: <acr0nym> The best part is that i've talked to this guy before.  It's an OS X server....  Which, frankly, also makes you have to wonder.
1274724535: <acr0nym> Heh.

1274725038: <dp> orly
1274725041: <typofoil> yeah
1274725043: <dp> upgraded video or something?
1274725046: <typofoil> Just checked
1274725054: <typofoil> no idea. I asked for an x200s and they gave me this
1274725063: <typofoil> And I've loved it
1274725069: <typofoil> It's powerful and small
1274725077: <dp> that's what I'm after
1274725093: <typofoil> This isn't even the new model
1274725100: <typofoil> the new one is based on a Core i7 IIRC
1274725116: <typofoil> Catch is, it's f'n expensive
1274725120: <typofoil> went to buy my own and it was $1600
1274725186: <fbx> you could get a friggin MBP for that kinda cash
1274725196: <fbx> i5 though
1274725215: <dp> I really wish I could find someone with an "extra" MB that would let me try it out for a couple of weeks
1274725225: <dp> I don't want to go drop the cash, and then find out I hate it
1274725802: <fbx> i really want a "stan mikita donut shop" t-shirt
1274725818: <fbx> seeing as the hawks made the cup finals and all
1274727186: <typofoil> Only the 3rd time I've downloadd ubuntu studio DVD... lets see if this works
1274727194: <typofoil> (download failed 90% in last time)
1274727264: <dp> typofoil: wget
1274727301: <typofoil> Will try that the next iteration
1274727307: <typofoil> the first I was on my corporate desktop
1274727310: <typofoil> over the weekend
1274727314: <dp> wget -c is the best
1274727314: <typofoil> it failed when I wasn't here

1274727456: <typofoil> Fuck, just failed again

1274727795: <typofoil> mostly level 3
1274727827: <dp> holy shit...
1274727832: <dp> I'm 8 hops
1274727836: <dp> and that box is in the UK
1274727904: <acr0nym> 1.5mb/s!  I win.
1274727910: <acr0nym> Oh, 1.8 now.
1274727916: <acr0nym> 2.2
1274727935: <dp> acr0nym: can you show me a traceroute?
1274727939: <dp> I'm just curious
1274727985: <acr0nym> 16 hops, also mostly level3
1274728008: <acr0nym> Want to see the whole thing?
1274728042: <dp> yeah; pastebin.dp.cx
1274728052: <dp> torrenting, I'm getting almost 1.2M/s
1274728081: <typofoil> Hops just increase latency, but if the pipes are fat you still get throughput
1274728344: <acr0nym> http://pastebin.dp.cx/pastebin.php?show=192993
1274728353: <acr0nym> Oh, I bet I could get it QUICK torrenting.
1274728396: <typofoil> Yeah yeah, show off your fa tpipe
1274728436: <acr0nym> Heh.
1274728438: <acr0nym> Damn skippy.
1274728459: <acr0nym> Right around 5mb/s now.  Says I should have it in 5 minutes.
1274728467: <acr0nym> Since I started it, I'll seed to a 10 ratio.  Heh.
1274728486: <dp> hrm
1274728492: <dp> I think somethings wrong with my network setup
1274728492: <TeleCon> What are you getting?
1274728498: <dp> I'm on a 100Mbps pipe
1274728500: <acr0nym> ubuntustudio-10.04-alternate-amd64.iso
1274728509: <acr0nym> I might, in fact, play with it...
1274728510: <acr0nym> Heh.
1274728518: <acr0nym> 6.1mb/s now.
1274728519: <TeleCon> Ah
1274728535: <typofoil> dp:  Doesn't matter how fat your pipe is if your upstream isn't fat too
1274728551: <typofoil> I know acr0nym has a damn fat upstream too
1274728556: <acr0nym> Yeah, forethought really is startlingly well connected, despite their EXTENSIVE other flaws.  ;)
1274728560: <typofoil> I used to peer with it
1274728587: <dp> typofoil: afaik, it's a 100M upstream too
1274728681: <typofoil> How well is the peering?
1274728692: <acr0nym> Done.
1274728697: <acr0nym> Seeding now.
1274728698: <acr0nym> Heh.
1274728708: <dp> typofoil: no idea.  it's sagonet though
1274728736: <typofoil> Yeah, I suspect forethought might be better connected :-)
1274728745: <typofoil> Sago isn't bad
1274728769: <dp> where would I find out?
1274728781: <typofoil> BGP tables
1274728820: <typofoil> there are public "looking glasses" that let you query BGP routes from various core routes around the internet
1274728840: <typofoil> For every IP you put in, it should return a list of routes
1274728871: <typofoil> http://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=lookingglass+ping+bgp&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
1274728955: <dp> so what am I actually looking for when I do that?
1274729063: <typofoil> put in the ip for your sago server and acro's server
1274729069: <typofoil> and you should get a list of routes
1274729087: <typofoil> you should be able to determine who your upstream peers are from that
1274729320: <acr0nym> Fuck, it's only 1:30?
1274729321: <acr0nym> Sheesh.
1274729331: <typofoil> damn, no wonder why I'm hungry
1274730978: <dp> ahhh
1274730985: <dp> seems that acr0 has multiple connections
1274730989: <dp> whereas I only have one
1274731005: <acr0nym> Yeah, peering, vs. "a peer".
1274731005: <acr0nym> Heh.
1274731183: <TeleCon> I would have thought I'd get better throughput when in Level3 corp hq, but not as much as you'd think.
1274731200: <acr0nym> Prolly lots o' QOS applied on chimps.
1274731205: <acr0nym> By which I mean employees.
1274731454: <dp> supposedly, sagonet has multiple connections though
1274731465: <dp> that's kind of disturbing
1274731484: <TeleCon> Yeah, but ops is usually excluded from that type of thing.  Especially caching and streaming ops.
1274731499: <TeleCon> And I would get full 100mbs from earth to my desk.
1274731507: <acr0nym> Oh, ah, hrmm.
1274731706: <dp> hrm... guess that explains why I only get 1-2M to/from my server
1274732085: <typofoil> I thought sago did have multiple peers 
1274732090: <typofoil> thats why I hoste with them originally
1274732091: <typofoil> WTF
1274732104: <typofoil> I remember they had multiple routes and everything
1274733278: <dp> looks like sagonet is only peering with TW right now
1274733289: <dp> http://www.fixedorbit.com/AS/21/AS21840.htm
1274733294: <dp> though that suggests otherwise
1274733766: --- acr0nym has changed the topic to: "Who looks at a screwdriver and thinks, 'Oohoo, this could be a little more sonic?'" -- Capt. Jack Harkness
1274733811: <typofoil> So, Jack is the "Face of Boe"
1274733823: <typofoil> or it was implied
1274733828: <acr0nym> Well, maybe.
1274733831: <acr0nym> Heh.
1274733832: <typofoil> I was catching up on my Dr Who 
1274733835: <acr0nym> Thay haven't fully confirmed it.
1274733857: <typofoil> Nor will they
1274733861: <acr0nym> Of course.
1274733869: <typofoil> they thing it's better to leave it a mystery
1274733933: <typofoil> why do I always mix up words like that?  bugs me
1274733939: <typofoil> s/thing/think/
1274733946: <typofoil> it's not a type, but a crosswire
1274734101: <dp> "Felipe A. Velasco" suggests SagoNet has 4 as well
1274734107: <dp> TW, PCCW, Internap and Tiscali
1274735279: <dp> ok.  the sagonet tech is suggesting that the peers used is partly determined based on transmission direction
1274735795: <dp> Felipe A. Velasco: your switch is setup incorrectly
1274735809: <dp> prepare for a hiccup
1274735856: <dp> *wow*
1274735958: <dp> speed just jumped to ~2M/s
1274736178: <typofoil> So.. what was the issue?
1274736187: <dp> the port on the switch wasn't autonegotiating
1274736267: <typofoil> oh, yeah
1274736278: <typofoil> I rememeber I had to manually set mine, back in the day
1274736410: <dp> I wrongly assumed it would have been fixed in almost 10 years
1274736421: <dp> so...
1274736429: <dp> I wonder how long it would take me to download studio now
1274736515: <typofoil> Less time than it's taking me to install it?
1274736521: <typofoil> I'm 30% done.
1274736567: <dp> right now, it's going at ~140K/s
1274736590: <dp> lets try the torrent, cause the cdimage server could be hammered
1274736621: <typofoil> yeah
1274736701: <dp> ~1.8Mbps
1274736708: <dp> no
1274736712: <dp> 3.5
1274736719: <dp> *much* better
1274736723: <dp> now, I'll let it seed too ;)
1274736791: <typofoil> 33%
1274737089: <typofoil> Some idiot pulled my name out of a previous email and assigned a CRITICAL ticket to me.
1274737121: <typofoil> So I responded to the ticket "I do not have access to perform this task.  Trying to find out who does so I can re-assign the ticket to them."
1274737180: <typofoil> Historical Note:  I've already told him this in email about 6 times
1274737992: <milkchan> woot.  found the spot in the hotel room that gets 5 4g bars.  ramming speeeed
1274738051: <milkchan> if you're catching up on dr who, you might want to catch up on torchwood too
1274738064: <milkchan> i think it was a torchwood ep that confirmed it
1274738336: <milkchan> haha.  a baseball game is so mindbogglingly boring that it would be the absolute ONLY place i would tolerate the risk of appearing douchebaggy enough to weild an ipad
1274738389: <TeleCon> lol
1274738506: <typofoil> milkchan: I've seen all torchwood, unless they released new stuff in the last few months
1274738590: <milkchan> twas the ep with capn jack's brother that confirmed it i thought
1274738690: <milkchan> hmm.  another place with 4g not showing up on the clear coverage map
1274738714: <milkchan> dudes better get your ass in gear before LTE shits your bed
1274738827: <typofoil> no episode confirmed it
1274738857: <typofoil> but several hint at it, one dr who episode even very directly (so much that jack says "They called me 'The Face of Boe'"
1274739246: <milkchan> that was confirmation enough for me unless they wanna pull a continuity fuck
1274739389: <typofoil> I suspect the face may come up again
1274739476: <milkchan> a little head goes a long way eh
1274743897: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: ]3d0g)
1274789430: <dp> milkchan: "confirmed it"?
1274791942: * fbx yawns
1274792137: <milkchan> it being the face of boe
1274793074: <dp> eh?
1274793080: <dp> shit... I forgot my towel
1274793464: <ouiji> Call in the national guard! 
1274793480: <ouiji> dp: have you not heard?
1274793490: <ouiji> there is a ban!
1274793535: <ouiji> no towells withen 500mi of US s0il!
1274793552: <ouiji> they are callng it the "TaliBan!"
1274793569: <ouiji> Dispose of it now!
1274793590: <ouiji> ahh
1274793682: <dp> hahhaa
1274799973: --> ]3d0g (jkarp@6988929A.F4AE6A51.BF63E968.IP) has joined #lobby
1274799973: <PipSqueek> ]3d0g: Prost!
1274800552: <typofoil> Heh, I came across a major bug in ubuntu 10.  Thankfully it's already been confirmed on May 17th
1274800564: <typofoil> Like a render my computer useless bug
1274800577: <typofoil> Will see if I can compile my report and submit it
1274800684: <typofoil> Symptoms:  High idle load average of 2.5-5.0.  CPU load <1%, no processes really fighting for anything, and spikes of load so high that the keyboard, mouse, and display freeze up for 1-5 seconds.
1274800698: <typofoil> the freeze-ups make troubleshooting VERY slow
1274800704: <fbx> wow
1274800707: <fbx> suck
1274800716: <fbx> any idea of root cause?
1274800739: <typofoil> None, but since it's not universal, I'm suspecting it's a chipset or driver issue
1274800753: <typofoil> but I'm not installing it on any more machines until it's fixed
1274800793: <typofoil> I'm going to see if I can compile lspci and dmesg and submit it to the bug
1274800810: <]3d0g> $97 dollah 3GSes at wal-mart.
1274801007: <typofoil> neat, my blog has 6 subscribers
1274801014: <typofoil> Didn't expect that :-)
1274801030: <typofoil> (2 tumblr followers and 4 rss subscribers)
1274801083: * dp is one follower
1274801145: <typofoil> Thanks :-0
1274801146: <typofoil> :-)
1274801159: <typofoil> I had 0 yesterday.  :-)
1274801187: <ouiji> How in the world is it.. that the "ubunFOOO" install on my quad core with 4gb of ram runs slower than my gentoo build on my p4 with 1.5gb o ram?
1274801205: <dp> ouiji: more graphical junk?
1274801217: <typofoil> ouiji: PEBCAK
1274801255: <typofoil> I am still a fan of gentoo, just not on the desktop
1274801276: <ouiji> thats what I did to your umm... female.. umm.. well I guess significant other typofoil
1274801325: <ouiji> and I have all of ubuntu's graphical "happy stuff" disables
1274801330: <ouiji> disabled*
1274801350: <typofoil> There could be plenty of reasons behind it
1274801350: <ouiji> which I shouldn't need to, as it is "Supported"
1274801358: <typofoil> I always disable effects
1274801372: <typofoil> Regardless how fast they are
1274801425: <typofoil> That being said, gnome is a heavy beast
1274801442: <dp> aye
1274801465: <typofoil> I do miss gentoo when it comes to development and server stuff
1274801477: <dp> we have 3 gentoo servers
1274801484: <dp> 2 CentOS servers
1274801490: <dp> a Debian server
1274801494: <dp> and an RHEL server
1274801500: <typofoil> *twitch*
1274801503: <dp> no shit
1274801504: <typofoil> choose one :-)
1274801508: <typofoil> even two
1274801508: <fbx> and a patridgeOS in a pear treeeeeeeeeee
1274801519: <dp> RHEL is a managed server, so I don't care about it
1274801531: <dp> Zimbra won't run on anything unix other than Debian
1274801539: <dp> and the CentOS boxes "are in the process"
1274801555: <typofoil> in the process of?
1274801566: <dp> being converted to Gentoo
1274801566: <fbx> become debian boxen
1274801569: <fbx> hahahah!
1274801574: <dp> but it will take several months
1274801576: <fbx> wrong distro, right answer
1274801586: <dp> as we have to migrate what's on there to the other gentoo servers
1274801598: <dp> fbx: I would have preferred debian
1274801599: <typofoil> If I were going to run a datacenter of cloned machines running custom configs, I'd run gentoo without question
1274801602: <dp> but it wasn't my call
1274801637: <typofoil> Harder to get going, but once you have a build and consistant methodologies, it's easy to support
1274801646: <typofoil> if I had to build out FAST, debian
1274801666: <ouiji> its a real waste of a box with:
1274801667: <ouiji> 680I LT LSI    4GB DDR2 PC2-8500
1274801740: <typofoil> Right now RH/Centos drive me nuts
1274801758: <typofoil> But they work
1274801776: <typofoil> I think it was more of an issue of how we were deploying them 
1274801785: <dp> yum is possibly the worst package manager of all time
1274801799: <ouiji> n a gtx-295 and a partrage and a pear tree
1274801845: <typofoil> Cued up 2 new posts on tumblr, waiting to see how long it takes before they auto-post
1274801849: <typofoil> I set up the frequency to 1 day
1274801862: <typofoil> so I can cue up a bunch of crap and it only posts once a day
1274801931: <typofoil> I went to set up a Ruby on Rails environment on Ubuntu a few weeks ago... what a pain in the ass
1274802061: <ouiji> i remember when I was blowing rails off this hooker named ruby... she rather enjoyed it
1274802151: <ouiji> although.. now that I think about it, mike was standing behind her giggeling.. maybe that was why she said it was a pain in her ass.
1274802723: <typofoil> ouiji: http://sinisterbrain.com/  and yes, there are several nudes on there.
1274802727: <typofoil> (female)
1274802783: <dp> typofoil: where do you take some of your shots?
1274802794: <dp> like
1274802799: <dp> http://sinisterbrain.com/post/625506517
1274802802: <dp> specifically
1274802826: <typofoil> That was Rialto Beach
1274802838: <typofoil> The water splashing over the rocks was Ruby beach
1274802847: <typofoil> both should be on google
1274802901: <dp> you should geotag them
1274802938: <typofoil> I was thinking about it
1274802952: <typofoil> but not leaves a reason for people to communicate :-)
1274803007: <dp> then I'll comment for you
1274803049: <dp> I wonder if you get an email about that
1274803070: <typofoil> Dunno, you'll be my first comment.  :-)
1274803072: <typofoil> Lets see
1274803123: <dp> ah.  you can sign up for it in disqus
1274803151: <typofoil> Yep it worked
1274803167: <typofoil> neat, thanks :-)
1274803289: <acr0nym> How's the wootoff for everybody?
1274803298: <]3d0g>  worst ever
1274803315: <dp> do you all hit woot every day?
1274803323: <]3d0g> of course
1274803330: <]3d0g> well, the goog reader does
1274803339: <dp> jesus, that laptop is massive
1274803341: <acr0nym> I aggregate it, and follow wootoff on twitter, so I have some idea when it's going on.
1274803341: <dp> 17.3"
1274803344: <acr0nym> Heh.
1274803371: <dp> I stopped reading the woot rss feed, because by the time I got to it every morning, the sale was already over
1274803400: <typofoil> That's not a lapto[
1274803402: <acr0nym> Hah! http://shirt.woot.com/friends.aspx?k=13441
1274803404: <typofoil> it's a confused desktop
1274803424: <acr0nym> typofoil: http://www.denverartmuseum.org/explore_art/temporaryExhibitionDetails/exhibitionId--193649/exhibitionType--Current
1274803429: <acr0nym> Come back and visit.  ;)
1274803641: <typofoil> nice :-)
1274803676: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: Here's one of typofoil's pix for you: http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l2ui9uoyu31qz87h7o1_500.jpg
1274803800: <typofoil> Part of me was thinking that the bump was if a pedistrian entered the crosswalk
1274804931: <]3d0g> why for me?
1274804944: <acr0nym> Heh, 4chan reference....
1274804994: <]3d0g> Ah. Needs to find a SAGE now for completeness. 
1274804999: <acr0nym> Heh.
1274805005: <acr0nym> I can't believe you missed it.
1274805023: <]3d0g> fucking head cold. need more coffee too
1274805027: <acr0nym> Ah, right.
1274805044: <typofoil> sage?
1274805064: <typofoil> I actually don't know the reference and my picture is being used for it :-)
1274805072: <typofoil> Please fill me in :-0
1274805100: <]3d0g> http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Sage
1274805107: <acr0nym> Or,  sage
1274805108: <acr0nym> Source: Futuba channel, the first and largest imageboard (japanese).
1274805108: <acr0nym> To 'sage' a thread is to put the word sage in the e-mail field. This prevents your stupid post from bumping the thread to the top of the board. On 4chan, it's generally considered a sign of disapproval of the subject of the thread. Personally, I sage most of my comments as a habit (rarely do I think my contributions are worth bumping to the top of the board).
1274805112: <acr0nym> The word comes from the japanese 'sage' (pronounced sa--gay, not s-age), which means 'to lower'. The opposite is called 'age', but since all posts default to this, there's no reason to put that in the email field. 
1274805144: <acr0nym>  http://wiki.iiichan.net/4chan_Glossary
1274805298: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: We MUST find funding to open a Sushi Donut shop here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ehxeFaU2wM
1274805515: <TeleCon> I'll have to watch that later
1274805535: <]3d0g> oh, man that's awesome
1274806291: <typofoil> Hey, why sage my picture?  :-p
1274806554: <]3d0g> no, you need to find a SAGE sign for balance.
1274806807: <acr0nym> Wow, HERE'S a bad wind day: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=12687506&id=582660522
1274806890: <typofoil> So, protesting in front of someone's house is a good idea now?
1274806914: <acr0nym> Huh?
1274810529: <typofoil> http://blogs.ajc.com/kyle-wingfield/2010/05/24/for-anyone-who-questions-the-use-of-union-thugs/?cxntfid=blogs_kyle_wingfield
1274810533: <typofoil> Sorry, had a meeting
1274810540: <typofoil> (rE: protesting)
1274812833: <acr0nym> So, I'm still lost....  Where's the protesting?
1274813114: <typofoil> Oh, a union showed up at someone's house and protested
1274813119: <acr0nym> Ahhhh.
1274813146: <typofoil> and not even a senior exec at a bank
1274813156: <typofoil> not even someone who lobbies for the bank
1274813173: <typofoil> Figured FBX would eat that up
1274813206: <acr0nym> He's pretty quiet today.
1274813243: <typofoil> google analytics is addictive
1274813251: <typofoil> I wonder how DP stays off it 
1274813364: <]3d0g> yeah, that was a nice perk of moving all my shit to goog apps. 
1274813371: <dp> because I have dp.cx
1274813377: <dp> they don't get a lot of traffic
1274813575: <fbx> what am i doing?
1274813577: <fbx> oh
1274813675: <fbx> yeah, kyle looks like he takes it in the ass
1274813751: <fbx> anyone quoting redstate loses about three quarters of their intellectual heft when the quote starts, but oh well
1274813758: <dp> wait
1274813760: <dp> what?
1274813891: <fbx> the ajc link from above
1274814322: <dp> ah
1274814347: <fbx> all sources point back to breitbart's websites
1274814359: <fbx> i can throw my house further than i trust that asshole
1274814374: <TeleCon> I think april 2 would make a better towel day.
1274814400: <acr0nym> Yeah, I was looking, again, at the logic, and there are multiple days I like better.  Ah, well.
1274814446: <acr0nym> Like, Feb, umm, 11th, 42nd day of year.....
1274814466: <acr0nym> Or, May 4th.  (Because you get 54 if you multiply six by nine.)
1274814468: <acr0nym> Heh.
1274814530: <fbx> yeah. sorry...happy towel day all!
1274814630: <]3d0g> I remember when the whole towel day discussion went down. many of us wanted the 42nd day of the year, but others didn't want to wait as that day had already passed.
1274814752: <acr0nym> Hrmm: http://everything2.com/title/Devolutionary+Oath
1274814972: <dp> anybody else seen IM2?
1274814981: <acr0nym> whatis im2
1274814982: <acr0nym> ?
1274814985: <TeleCon> Though, given the abitrary property of both the question, and answer, may 25th works.
1274815006: <TeleCon> And it happens to be root and my wedding anniversary.
1274815015: <acr0nym> It is?  Wow, I suck.
1274815017: <dp> iron man 2
1274815018: <fbx> two weeks after 5/11/01 is fairly arbitrary, no?
1274815027: <acr0nym> dp: Oh, yeah, I've seen it.
1274815042: <fbx> TeleCon: happy anniversary, then!
1274815058: <acr0nym> Yeah, Happy Anniversary.  Heh.
1274815132: <fbx> apparently 6 x9 =42 in base13
1274815173: <fbx> so what's 42(b13) in decimal?
1274815247: <fbx> nm
1274815275: <dp> acr0nym: http://blog.dp.cx/181/iron-man-2
1274815296: <TeleCon> thanks
1274815348: <acr0nym> there's a "typical" Russian Super-Genius?
1274815361: <dp> well, in the movies there is
1274815367: <dp> that can hack any computer
1274815371: <dp> break in to any network
1274815372: <dp> etc
1274815508: <dp> I'm trying to find an example
1274815576: <acr0nym> Huh.  I had no idea.
1274815582: <dp> here you go
1274815584: <dp> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCracker
1274815610: <acr0nym> Huh.  There's no reference to being russian there...  Heh.
1274815631: <dp> bah
1274815708: <dp> jebus... wp is being *slow*
1274816205: <]3d0g> shirt.woot sale on the woot-off right now
1274816350: <TeleCon> You know what would make a good shirt woot off?
1274816358: <acr0nym> If the servers could stay up?
1274816364: <TeleCon> Classic shirts, that they haven't had in years.
1274816372: <TeleCon> Like the Radioactive Masonic Monkey shirt.
1274816411: <fbx> what good's a shirt woot i can't get to because the site's unresponsive
1274816439: <TeleCon> Good point
1274816512: <TeleCon> But, $$ off Reckoning shirts doesn't do anything for me.  I already have the ones I want.
1274816517: <TeleCon> Got em when they were 10
1274816562: <fbx> ooo - i didn't. i may have to pick up a couple
1274816618: <TeleCon> That's why I'd like to see a classics woot off on shirts.
1274816625: <TeleCon> I need to replace some.
1274816630: <fbx> nevermore...still there
1274816631: <fbx> wow
1274816663: <TeleCon> http://shirt.woot.com/friends.aspx?k=5596 is the one I want to replace.
1274816728: <fbx> i may just have to buy the binge
1274816970: <acr0nym> I'm torn between "how rainbows are made" and "@-@"
1274816986: <fbx> @-@ is classic
1274817018: <typofoil> I like @-@
1274817021: <typofoil> that is a classic
1274817034: <typofoil> But then I like typography and fantasy
1274817041: <acr0nym> Yeah.
1274817048: <typofoil> well, scifi more than fantasy, but Star Wars is Fantasy, and I like it...

1274885302: <PipSqueek> ]3d0g: Prost!
1274888121: <typofoil> Yeah pretty much anyone who chooses xubuntu over ubuntu is an idiot.  I did install lubuntu last night and was surprised at how good it was.
1274888158: <typofoil> seriously, I was really surprised to find out that xubuntu has a larger footprint than ubuntu does
1274888191: <]3d0g> huh? WTF is wrong with xubuntu?
1274888195: * ]3d0g ran it for years.
1274888208: <typofoil> I know, I was fucking with you on the idiot bit
1274888235: <typofoil> found out last night when looking up information on lubuntu that someone ran a comparison between ubuntu, xubuntu, and lubuntu
1274888256: <typofoil> xubuntu consistantly came out on top for memory usage (ie - higher numbers) - even on a clean boot
1274888273: <]3d0g> Even back on fedora like I am now, it's XFCE all the way. 
1274888274: <typofoil> lubuntu used less than half
1274888281: <]3d0g> motherfucking BULLETPROOF and does what I need.
1274888321: <typofoil> So for all the crap gnome gets for bloat, it uses less memory than xfce 
1274888347: <]3d0g> it's had a lot more development attention. 
1274888351: <typofoil> yep
1274888360: <typofoil> It's still bloated and overcomplicated
1274888393: <typofoil> I'm surprised with lubuntu.  It's very usable for being so minimal
1274888410: <]3d0g> I just despise the whole move of gnome to a monolithic registery, just like windows.
1274888423: * typofoil nods
1274888429: <typofoil> even E went that route
1274888451: <typofoil> speaking of glitzy WM's that use a lot less resources than they are known for
1274888497: <]3d0g> E was lean as hell. unfortunately it was also terminally alpha
1274888507: <typofoil> yeah
1274888523: <typofoil> The latest E is fucking amazing concept code
1274888525: <typofoil> it needs some TLC
1274888598: <]3d0g> Oh, lubuntu isn't Canonical endorsed...
1274888604: <typofoil> Not yet
1274888609: <typofoil> They are working on it
1274888621: <typofoil> and the quality I've experienced right out of the box, they are not far off
1274888635: <typofoil> For being so minimal, it's impressive
1274888663: <typofoil> Pretty much you can install everything you would normally, and it all works fine
1274888679: <typofoil> minimal dependencies
1274888680: <]3d0g> I'm sticking with fedora. I manage too much RH and the differences between RH and *ubuntu were just too much for my feeble brain
1274888687: <typofoil> hehe
1274888692: <typofoil> that's logical
1274888707: <TeleCon> Funny, that's the reason I despise Rhell
1274888738: <]3d0g> I can even live migrate VMs off the cluster right onto my desktop.
1274888763: <typofoil> Heh!
1274888768: <typofoil> Seriously?
1274888772: <]3d0g> sure
1274888778: <typofoil> Ok, I need to see this
1274888837: <]3d0g> I just add my desktop as a cluster node. It can see the same iscsi storage.
1274888926: <]3d0g> Just crossed the 50% consumption point of my 12T SAN today. It ain't even been up 6 months. Time to order more drives.

1274889516: <fbx> and if so, WTF are you backing up that's consumed 6T in 6 months?
1274889544: <]3d0g> not backup. hosting a number of video encoding apps.
1274889575: <]3d0g> I don't now have the space to migrate the IT systems this cluster was originally intended for.
1274889623: <]3d0g> 12T physical. 15T presently allocated and 5T of IT systems still to migrate.
1274890343: <]3d0g> been dabbling with chrome the past couple days now that it's "legit". One interesting thing I notice, its window doesn't shadow like all other XFCE windows do. 
1274890439: <]3d0g> Ahh, it's the "compact borders" option.
1274890629: <typofoil> ]3d0g: Do you have a sanitized visio (or equiv) of your environment, and a list of software that you use so I can learn what you are doing?

1274890825: <]3d0g> typofoil: here's a simple representation I did of the cluster for the unwashed masses here. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5919290/luna%20cluster.jpg
1274890925: <typofoil> what's your iscsi host?
1274890932: <typofoil> need a point of reference :-)
1274890946: <]3d0g> the SAN? At the top. Compellejnt.
1274890950: <]3d0g> Compellent.
1274890968: <typofoil> thanks :-)
1274890971: <typofoil> Oh I see
1274890974: <]3d0g> two separate iSCSI networks. 
1274890984: <]3d0g> .155 and .156
1274891002: <]3d0g> each node has 4 active iSCSI sessions
1274891047: <typofoil> Is that a comercial cluster or commidity hardware with a general purpose OS?
1274891088: <]3d0g> RHEL5.5 Cluster Suite. 
1274891098: <typofoil> Nice
1274891110: <]3d0g> Node specs @ the bottom
1274891137: <typofoil> Damn
1274891161: <typofoil> Each node has 10x10Ge?   Damn
1274891166: <]3d0g> yup
1274891190: <typofoil> you don't fool around
1274891235: <]3d0g> 40 VMs and 6T of NFS hosted and none of the 4 nodes go much beyond 5% utilization.
1274891371: <typofoil> I'm really disliking empathy

1274900127: <typofoil> I'm an asshole. :-)
1274900186: <typofoil> Someone called in asking for VPN support for his linux workstation
1274900194: <typofoil> The group sent him to me
1274900234: <typofoil> I told him it's unsupported, and he'd have to figure it out himself.  Else I recommend he installed windows as his host OS or within a virtual machine
1274900293: <typofoil> after a conversation of "but...but...but"
1274900306: <typofoil> found out he's running linux within vmware on a windows host
1274900526: <typofoil> I mean, I'm all for linux on the desktop
1274900533: <typofoil> It's against corporate standards
1274900546: <typofoil> But users still expect that they'll be supported if they run it
1274900599: <typofoil> Especially when we're under deadline to deliver a new VPN to 6000 users in the next 4 weeks
1274900644: <typofoil> No, we are not going out of our way to figure out how to install a VPN on your random choise linux distribution. 
1274900822: <fbx> how different could they all be, really? a base install, i mean
1274900825: <fbx> ipsec vpn
1274900858: <fbx> if the client supports your options, shouldn't really be anything other than figuring out how to config the client for those options
1274900869: <fbx> and either that's documented or it's not
1274900872: <fbx> :)
1274900959: <typofoil> Actually, the cisco vpn is supported on linux. It's the 2nd factor authentication is windows/osx software that is installed on the laptop.  Does not support linux
1274900999: <fbx> 2nd factor?
1274901001: <dp> fuck this week
1274901011: <fbx> what are you using for that?
1274901022: <typofoil> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication
1274901041: <fbx> uh
1274901041: <fbx> right
1274901043: <fbx> so
1274901046: <fbx> what are you using for that?
1274901053: <fbx> card?
1274901053: <typofoil> RSA soft tokens.  Much cheaper than physical tokens, so we made the decision to not support the physical tokens
1274901055: <fbx> ah
1274901069: <typofoil> Installing the software by default on all laptops
1274901076: <typofoil> all laptops have full encryption
1274901090: * fbx is a tad insulted at the LMGTFY nature of typofoil's response ;)
1274901101: <typofoil> ;-)
1274901108: <fbx> ya smartass
1274901125: <fbx> what was the price diff physical vs soft tokens?
1274901128: <fbx> or do you know?
1274901134: <typofoil> Essencially we turned the laptop into "something you have"
1274901141: <typofoil> I dunno
1274901145: <typofoil> above my paygrade
1274901147: <fbx> right
1274901154: <fbx> got it
1274901169: <typofoil> for 6000 users it was aparently a HUGE difference
1274901191: <fbx> so you need rsa to support soft tokens on a linux distro? good luck hehe
1274901197: <fbx> not you, per se
1274901199: <fbx> the user
1274901205: <typofoil> yep
1274901214: <typofoil> But back to my point
1274901220: <fbx> i'm a little surprised they support macs
1274901233: <typofoil> 6000+ windows hosts
1274901236: <fbx> yeah
1274901240: <fbx> i hear ya
1274901245: <fbx> 4 weeks
1274901256: <typofoil> and 1 linux user expectes us to go out of our way to support him because he wants to deviate from policy he agreed to
1274901272: <fbx> actually, 20 days total, no?
1274901286: <typofoil> no idea
1274901286: <fbx> or are you doing weekends too?
1274901288: <typofoil> but yeaj
1274901294: <fbx> yikes
1274901300: <fbx> how big's the team?
1274901353: <fbx> 300 users, 300 installs, 300 passwords (at least) a day
1274901359: <fbx> on average

1274901375: <typofoil> I'm a minor player
1274901383: <fbx> ambitious!
1274901389: <typofoil> It's nothing new

1274991943: <acr0nym> Yeah, saw that on wikipedia.

1275065610: <fbx> my abd
1275065611: <typofoil> oh?
1275065612: <fbx> and bad
1275065614: <fbx> yeah
1275065641: <fbx> to the point where he blithely said we might have to fish or cut bait on our phone system en toto
1275065653: <typofoil> wow
1275065663: <typofoil> is it that bad?
1275065691: <fbx> and i countered i thought it highly suspect that we replace the entire system over what amounts to 1% dropped voicemails over the last few months
1275065707: <fbx> actually, i bet i can prove it's less than that
1275065748: <typofoil> Was his or one of his boss' voicemails dropped?
1275065788: <fbx> no, it's not that bad, it's just my answers were not the ones he wanted to hear, so when i decided to not get completely technical in a room of fairly non-tech folks, he got fed up and pissy
1275065801: <fbx> yeah - the CEO has had the issue 3 times
1275065809: <fbx> at least, 3 i know of
1275065839: <typofoil> Are you sure he didn't accidently delete them?
1275065852: <fbx> i'm pretty sure i can prove that's 1% or less of his VMs too, but...i like my job enough to not be a total dick to the CEO
1275065860: <fbx> no - he gets cut off while leaving them
1275065872: <typofoil> mobile phone?
1275065883: <fbx> no- desk to desk within our PBX
1275065886: <typofoil> wow
1275065902: <typofoil> has his phone been eliminated as suspect?
1275065908: <typofoil> Sorry
1275065911: <typofoil> Troubleshooting mode
1275065912: <fbx> we have what amounts to an analog setting for silence in the config that needs to be turned off
1275065935: <fbx> and the VM system doesn't need to be looking for that
1275065972: <fbx> yeah - it's something the manufacturer is addressing with the config change we're putting in this weekend
1275065976: <fbx> it's not his phone
1275066009: <fbx> loopstart silence detection needs to be turn off, and that's what the config change does
1275066065: <fbx> however, since i thought we were looking at other DSP changes, i boffed the not-so-tech descrip this morning, which (i think) made him think we (me & the pbx vendor) were guessing
1275066078: <fbx> the whole episode did piss me off
1275066094: <fbx> especially the flippant way he brought about the change
1275066125: <fbx> seeing as we spent about 7x that amount on changing our core systems and that thing's been down far, far more than the phone system has
1275066151: <fbx> all we hear about on that is how good it is
1275066156: <fbx> because the ceo likes that core
1275066169: <fbx> he liked the PRICE of the phone system
1275066187: <fbx> so it's quality is open to judgement, i suppose
1275066201: <acr0nym> What kinda system?
1275066206: <fbx> vertical
1275066213: <acr0nym> Never heard of it.

1275068637: <TeleCon> acr0nym: You at work today?
1275068976: <typofoil> I can't believe it's 2010 and we still have people asking for shared user accounts
1275069000: <typofoil> with sudo privs
1275069045: <typofoil> And the justifications the user used?  It made me want to reply with "Anyone who requires sudo privledges should already know how this works."
1275069059: <typofoil> One reason?  SSH key generation
1275069075: <typofoil> Why do they have to generate different keys when they could create one and give it to everyone
1275069110: <typofoil> why would they do that?  because not everyone knows how to roll their own keys, of course
1275069118: <typofoil> but yet you want me to give them sudo privledges.
1275069125: <typofoil> Yeah, find qualified people.
1275069247: <typofoil> I need to create a request form for people who want sudo access
1275069258: <typofoil> to get sudo access you have to pass the quiz

1275070583: <typofoil> Oh
1275070594: <typofoil> <0.1%
1275070663: <dp> I'm curious if there's a commandline way to post to tumblr
1275070681: <dp> probably is
1275070715: <typofoil> How do you think I do it?
1275070718: <typofoil> I wrote a perl script
1275070735: <typofoil> well, I used the WWW::Tumblr module
1275070748: <typofoil> I have a script which already annotates images
1275070754: <typofoil> scales, then annotates
1275070762: <dp> and posts?
1275070764: <typofoil> so the annotation is the same size regardless of the size image
1275070771: <typofoil> I'm modifying it to post, yes
1275070775: <typofoil> I have a seperate script to post
1275070782: <typofoil> But I have the script post to the "queue" 
1275070784: <dp> you should set it so that it adds them to a queue
1275070790: <typofoil> and Tumble is set to post no more than once per day
1275070822: <typofoil> Them I also have tumblr set to post to Facebook and Twitter
1275070853: <typofoil> The reason why I don't use flickr or picasa is because there is no server side way to queue
1275070864: <typofoil> I don't want to flood people with updates
1275070885: <typofoil> I was to do one piece of beauty a day - at most
1275070929: <dp> what the fuck
1275070936: <dp> why can I only see like 10 items in a menu?
1275070984: <typofoil> ?
1275071070: <typofoil> Wow, currently 0.01% of my images are posted
1275071110: <typofoil> I'd have to say that about 3000 of them are experimentation and will never be seen publically.  
1275071134: <dp> I need to figure out a way to get the gnome main menu in to lubuntu's lxde
1275071153: <typofoil> you mean gnome panel?
1275071167: <dp> yes
1275071205: <typofoil> Doesn't that defeat the purpose
1275071207: <typofoil> ?
1275071227: <dp> except that lxde != gnome
1275071234: <dp> I want the *data*
1275071237: <typofoil> Wow, 0.0077% to be exact
1275071943: <dp> typofoil: plan to make your scripts public?

1275407277: <]3d0g> had just as many quirks / issues with it as FF, wasn't any faster, and I missed my Add-ons.
1275407311: <dp> interesting.  I'm seeing almost 2x the speed
1275407318: <dp> granted, that's not scientific or anything
1275407423: <]3d0g> yeah, I was curious after all the claims. I keep my FF very tidy and never had a speed complaint to begin with.
1275413690: <dp> what is the sysadm application started at google for unning the same commands across a multitude of machines?
1275413701: <dp> I thought it was slack, but apparently, I'm mistaken
1275414167: <dp> nope, it's slack
1275414172: <dp> now, to implement it

1275414736: <acr0nym> Heh, this is an interesting Treemap: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/10187248.stm

1275416728: <tinfoil> Weird, my workstation at work is dual monitor, but they are seperate desktops
1275416754: <tinfoil> I can't drag windows between them
1275416761: <tinfoil> but my mouse and keyboard work in both
1275416765: <acr0nym> Kill it with fire!
1275416797: <tinfoil> Got a new slew of erotic photos over the weekend.  Wow, these ones came out amazing
1275416808: <tinfoil> With a little more practice, I may get good.  :-)
1275416813: <tinfoil> You guys have a good weekend?

1275418428: <acr0nym> Hrmm, "Meet the Last Generation of Typewriter Repairmen" http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2010/05/gallery-typewriters/all/1
1275418961: <dp> hrm... I need to determine how long it will take to upgrade mysql on this gentoo box
1275418992: <tinfoil> Assuming you build all the packages on another box, it should take about the same as upgrading on any other distibution
1275419030: <tinfoil> My lubuntu box is quirky
1275419047: <tinfoil> It was quirky running ubuntu 10 and lubuntu 10
1275419064: <dp> not building on another box
1275419066: <tinfoil> it was not quirky running ubuntu 9.1
1275419092: <tinfoil> build to a binary package, but don't install it until you're ready :-)
1275419106: <tinfoil> that way you're not waiting on a compile
1275419112: <tinfoil> waiting/watching
1275419114: <tinfoil> you can do other things
1275419181: <dp> well, if I emerge <opts>, how do I build to a binary package?
1275419373: <tinfoil> Dunno, I haven't touched gentoo in nearly 2 years
1275419379: <tinfoil> I used to do it all the time
1275419393: <tinfoil> Mainly because I had 1 build box and a bunch of clones
1275419422: <dp> worthless :P
1275419433: <tinfoil> Knowing a feature is there is better than not
1275419450: <dp> only if you can find it
1275419455: <tinfoil> gentoo has a great package management system, but its features aren't clear unless you master it
1275419479: <tinfoil> man make.conf
1275419494: <tinfoil> It's an option in there
1275419558: <dp> emerge --buildpkgonly
1275419575: <tinfoil> there you go
1275419578: <tinfoil> not worthless
1275419589: <tinfoil> There is a way you need to tell it to install the binary package only too
1275419600: <tinfoil> so when you build the package, you don't rebuild it when you go to install it
1275419605: <dp> that's buildpkgonly
1275419606: <tinfoil> :-)
1275419610: <dp> buildpkg will build and install
1275419628: <tinfoil> No, you miss understood
1275419631: <dp> how do you install just the package then?
1275419639: <tinfoil> I forget
1275419639: <dp> oh
1275419643: <tinfoil> but that was what I meant
1275419644: <dp> I see what you're saying
1275419648: <tinfoil> build it only
1275419655: <tinfoil> then install it only
1275419707: <dp> --rebuilt-binaries
1275419714: <dp> Replace  installed  packages with binary packages that have been rebuilt.
1275419738: <dp> ah, no
1275419742: <dp> --usepkg
1275420202: <dp> awesome!
1275420205: <tinfoil> Sorry I couldn't tell you details, but glad I could help
1275420219: <dp> installed to /usr/share/packages/dev-db/mysql-5.0.90-r2.tbz2
1275420243: <dp> will have to install that later, and see how it goes
1275420260: <tinfoil> It wasn't just me being insane - I truly would use gentoo for a cloned environment
1275420280: <tinfoil> it's pretty nifty for somethings
1275420283: <tinfoil> just not everything :-)
1275420404: <dp> I have to say, that's pretty neat
1275420587: <tinfoil> So what I'd do is have a machine check for updates weekly (or forced daily for known security issues), download and build all updated packages to my specifications and dependencies
1275420609: <tinfoil> then the clone machines looked at that machine via rsync to update the packages
1275420613: <tinfoil> no building
1275420669: <tinfoil> I did have distcc setup, so that compilation was spread across about 32 CPU's
1275420685: <tinfoil> could rebuild the entire OS in like an hour.  :-)
1275420702: <tinfoil> It does help to put the builddir into tmpfs too
1275420929: <tinfoil> you'll get a 30-50% increase in speed building in tmpfs for some packages that are spread across lots of small files (like the kernel, for example)
1275423065: <tinfoil> Damn, those new photos are gaining a lot of attention
1275423125: <dp> they on tumblr?
1275423174: <tinfoil> Not yet
1275423192: <tinfoil> they're fairly erotic, so I need to give them a better look before choosing which go on tumblr
1275423210: <tinfoil> no open crotch, and only one nipple
1275423218: <tinfoil> but still :-)
1275423277: <dp> tag them as nsfw ;)
1275423284: <tinfoil> Hehehe
1275423299: <tinfoil> I'm just being more picky as to what erotic material ends up on there. :-)
1275423747: <tinfoil> I emailed it to you 
1275423749: <tinfoil> NSFW
1275423774: <tinfoil> There is no genitalia, just a nipple in a single photo
1275424282: <acr0nym> DAMMIT.  I want genitalia.
1275424287: <tinfoil> Sorry :-)
1275424311: <acr0nym> Heh, it's more of a general comment on the world, than your photos.
1275424312: <acr0nym> Heh.
1275424326: <tinfoil> I was there with another photographer last night
1275424331: <tinfoil> he was taking pictures of her crotch

1275491636: <dp> still not "right"

1275498462: <acr0nym> "Not currently" is what I started to type.
1275498701: <dp> tinfoil: ubuntu+1, as it's called
1275498766: <dp> it's the next version
1275499231: <tinfoil> Oh
1275499304: <tinfoil> Got a new apartment last night
1275499317: <tinfoil> http://images.craigslist.org/3nb3ma3l95T05Q25U0a5v66b5be39f5d510a6.jpg

1275499855: <acr0nym> Heh.Nice.
1275499899: <tinfoil> It's cheaper rent than where I'm at
1275499921: <tinfoil> Of course, paying for parking makes it almost even
1275499935: <tinfoil> It's as big as the place I'm in, but all one big space
1275499944: <tinfoil> 16ft ceilings
1275500080: <]3d0g> wow, it has an indoor fort!
1275500097: <tinfoil> Yep :-)
1275500118: <tinfoil> Tracy and I were talking that I could fit everything I owned on/under the loft area
1275500128: <tinfoil> leaving the rest open for my photo studio
1275500241: <tinfoil> leaving the rest open for my photo studio
1275500244: <tinfoil> Whoops
1275500309: <tinfoil> http://gizmodo.com/5553418/att-just-killed-unlimited-wireless-data-and-screwed-everybody-in-the-process
1275500329: <]3d0g> Don't you know Apple's PISSED?
1275500389: <tinfoil> That's what they get for being carrier centric
1275500429: <tinfoil> I wonder what the terms of the contract are
1275500441: <tinfoil> between AT&T and Apple, I mean
1275500532: <]3d0g> Considering the WWAN iPad is HEAVILY marketed on the no-contract $30 unlimited, I'd say Apple got fucked :)
1275500711: <tinfoil> Clearwire is putting out 4G/3G/2G devices later this year
1275500717: <tinfoil> Android based
1275500728: <tinfoil> as of yet, Clearwire is making a point that they are truly unlimited
1275500732: <]3d0g> Evo comes out in a couple days.
1275500762: <tinfoil> Oh, clearwire is deploying in Denver too
1275500771: <]3d0g> So is Sprint
1275500783: <tinfoil> Sprint 4g = Clearwire
1275500787: <tinfoil> Comcast 4g = clearwire
1275500830: <tinfoil> Sprint deployed the first 4G in the country and it was a disaster (a little too early in the game)
1275500832: <]3d0g> not =. Partners
1275500845: <tinfoil> Clearwire is the backbone
1275500961: <]3d0g> And, Clearwire WiMAX is only 4G in marketing only.
1275501027: <tinfoil> We call it 4g
1275501040: <tinfoil> Still, I'm not promoting it because I drank the coolaid
1275501048: <tinfoil> It's pretty much the coolest wireless I've used to date
1275501056: <tinfoil> Ask *chan
1275501076: <tinfoil> When you have coverage, it rocks
1275501200: <]3d0g> Long term, Sprint may have chosen the wrong horse. We'll see...
1275501225: <tinfoil> competition is good
1275501269: <tinfoil> Considering clear is the only horse, there isn't much to bet on
1275501287: <tinfoil> In terms of major WiMAX providers
1275501288: <]3d0g> All other carriers are going LTE
1275501394: <tinfoil> Depends... How many LTE providers are there?
1275501426: <tinfoil> Of course, that's a short term question
1275501443: <]3d0g> Verizon, ATT, TMO, Orange, and Vodaphone have all made commitments, supposedly.
1275501489: <tinfoil> My perspective is that WiMAX works now, and it works well
1275501501: <]3d0g> definitely has the head-start
1275501504: <tinfoil> I don't have much loyalty to technology if I run across something better :-)
1275501528: <tinfoil> Right now, my WiMAX is faster than my DSL
1275501539: <]3d0g> but it can't do voice, right?
1275501547: <tinfoil> It can't?
1275501549: <tinfoil> Wow
1275501551: <tinfoil> :-)
1275501553: <tinfoil> It can :-0
1275501556: <tinfoil> works great
1275501572: <]3d0g> you sure? the Evo has separate radios
1275501585: <tinfoil> Clearwire is a VoIP provider
1275501586: <]3d0g> I could have misread
1275501617: <tinfoil> We provide VoIP to our 3G customers (though I'm assuming it sucks as bad as the 3G service)
1275501658: <tinfoil> When I tried the 3G service (before I knew we had 4G), I almost quit
1275501685: <tinfoil> I live in one of the most major areas of Seattle, and barely had 1 bar of service
1275508034: <dp> fuck!
1275508041: <dp> I hate being responsible for our email
1275508047: <dp> our IT guy is supposed to do this shit

1275508050: <dp> but he's too fucking stupid!
1275508060: <dp> I DOSd our mail server
1275508076: <tinfoil> That's a problem... how?
1275508080: <dp> sent about 50k messages to myself
1275508084: <dp> script run amok
1275508090: <tinfoil> Nice job!
1275508093: <dp> yeah
1275508116: <tinfoil> My record in currently 1200, but it went to 10 people including my boss.  :-)
1275508138: <dp> worst part is, there's still about 23k messages sitting on the remote server, waiting to hit the mail server
1275508170: <tinfoil> Can you kill the queue on the remote box?>
1275508197: <dp> dunno, honestly
1275508291: <dp> there.  deleting 20k messages

1275511677: <]3d0g> Awww, poor spongebob. http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l37rtxdq4q1qzlfumo1_500.jpg
1275511783: <fbx> so i could roughly fill my car on 87 octane refined from that spill in a matter of...say, 4 seconds
1275511833: <]3d0g> They sad on the evening news last night that the total spill thus far is less than 1 hour's consumption of the US.
1275511857: <fbx> I could fill up my car for the year in almost 8 and a half minutes. That's about 39k miles.
1275511920: <]3d0g> 30 gal/gas per barrel, right?
1275511944: <tinfoil> It's such a wonderful day.  The rainbows in the water are beautiful.
1275511980: <fbx> about 19-20 gal gas per 42 gallon barrel is my EIA estimate
1275511990: * ]3d0g ponders the SPF of crude. this could be a PLUS!
1275512012: <acr0nym> Come on, it's just "pre-blackening" for Cajun food!

1275523949: <tinfoil> yeah
1275523990: <tinfoil> I was thinking of finding all the "free" (or hackable free) dns relays out there and using them to host a distributed DNS-BL based upon the spam data I was collecting at Comfluent
1275524030: <tinfoil> Since my data was all in SQL, it was easy to populate mydns's tables
1275524058: <tinfoil> Then set up 12-hour domain/record caching.  :-)
1275524088: <tinfoil> nowhere in the publically available dns records would be anything that would have lead back to comfluent

1275585539: <tinfoil> We had a group here (from india) that asked for a service account
1275585542: <tinfoil> So I gave it to them
1275585549: <tinfoil> then they asked for the password
1275585554: <tinfoil> It's a linux account, for a service...
1275585568: <tinfoil> no need for a password
1275585582: <tinfoil> then they tried to tell me it needed sudo before I could reply
1275585590: <]3d0g> set one and leave the shell @ /sbin/nologin. 
1275585595: <tinfoil> I did
1275585613: <tinfoil> Then they tell me that they couldn't log into the shell
1275585634: <]3d0g> tell 'em Kwik-E-Mart's hiring.
1275585638: <tinfoil> It ends up the entire group was expected to log into a shared account that has sudo
1275585698: <tinfoil> So... you're telling me that you want 20+ users from around the world to log into a single account that has root access to our machines?
1275585703: <tinfoil> Yeah
1275585709: <tinfoil> Sorry, I'm annoyed

1275585911: <tinfoil> they will hire any idiot
1275585919: <tinfoil> which is a shame, because it makes India look bad
1275585932: <]3d0g> fuck that. they've looked bad for decades.

1275587055: <ouiji> acr0nym: can you make the introduction? ; )  *Wink Wink*
1275587057: <tinfoil> Cabinet = a DBM (hash database) that is significantly faster than other DBM's
1275587062: <tinfoil> and also smaller
1275587092: <tinfoil> Tyrant = Network front end to Cabinet that supports distribution and replication
1275587113: <tinfoil> and server-side embeded scripting (via lua)
1275587134: <tinfoil> So it's a persistant distributed highly simplistic database
1275587173: <tinfoil> milkchan told me about it
1275587570: <dp> yeah, it's a NoSQL deal
1275587578: <dp> similar to MongoDB and others
1275587585: <dp> I haven't used *it*, but I have used Mongo
1275587724: <tinfoil> Last time I looked at Mongo, it looked very beta

1275590371: <fbx> poignant?
1275590378: <tinfoil> and they have >100K followers where actual BP has like 7k
1275590378: <tinfoil> yeah
1275590405: <tinfoil> BP won't shut them down either

1275590561: <tinfoil> "Can't we just call it the oilcean and move on already? #bpcares"

1275590809: <fbx> I.ve read a bunch of articles and blogs about this whole situation by publicists and marketing folk wondering what BP should do to save their brand from @BPGlobalPR.  First of all, who cares?  Second of all, what kind of business are you in?  I.m trashing a company that is literally trashing the ocean, and these idiots are trying to figure out how to protect that company?  One pickledick actually suggested that BP approach me and try to incorporate me into their act
1275590881: <tinfoil> "We feel terrible about spilling oil in American waters, we'll make sure the next spill happens where the terrorists live. #bpcares"
1275590945: <tinfoil> "We plan on spending millions of dollars to fix this mess. We also plan on jacking gas prices so high that you'll wish you never complained."
1275591320: <tinfoil> The funny thing is that there are PR people who've been complimenting BPglobalPR's PR skills
1275591348: <fbx> As part of our continued re-branding effort, we are now referring to the spill as "Shell Oil's Gulf Coast Disaster". #bpcares
1275591966: <fbx> The oil leak was caused by a natural gas explosion, or sea fart, which is now having silent but deadly consequences. #bpseafart
1275592010: <tinfoil> I thought you would appreciate that
1275592063: <fbx> the ever deadly sea fart
1275592067: <fbx> brilliant
1275592173: <tinfoil> The best part is, bpglobalpr has reached such critical mass that if BP does make a serious attempt to do anything about bpglobalpr, it will confirm (and thus martyr) bpglobalpr

1275592616: <]3d0g> Dude. We got Dells.
1275592623: <dp> thought so
1275592630: <dp> they're just so fscking expensive
1275592634: <fbx> Due to public outcry, our "Spill Or Be Spilled" flash game will be taken off our BP Kidz Klub website. "Smack the Greasy Manatee" stays.
1275592661: <]3d0g> Good server hardware ain't ever cheap.
1275592669: <fbx> dp: but if you have a problem and a warranty, they'll ship you replacement pieces parts pronto
1275592682: <dp> fbx: we've not had a problem with hardware in 16 months
1275592682: <fbx> i've been there with hp, dell and compaq back in the day
1275592692: <dp> and the owners of the company are cheap
1275592694: <fbx> dell is consistently on top of that shit
1275592698: <]3d0g> hell, if I don't feel like turning a screw, Dell has a tech on site to do it in 4 hours.
1275592708: <fbx> ]3d0g: there ya go

1275592729: <fbx> dp: you gets what you pays for, my friend
1275592758: <]3d0g> Dells are insanely Linux friendly too. Never needed a driver disk for shit.
1275592767: <fbx> they started getting stupid a few years back. then michael dell came back and fired some executives
1275592773: <fbx> they're doing shit right again now
1275592778: * fbx wonders why....
1275592798: <dp> fbx: I know that as well
1275592804: <dp> but again, the owners of the company are cheap
1275592811: <dp> we're also insanely small right now
1275592832: <fbx> then go cheap, but have replacement parts on the shelves
1275592893: <dp> plus, all the Dell 1Us seem to only allow a single socket
1275593044: <tinfoil> Density = more heat and electricity per rack.  More heat = more AC and better AC distribution
1275593060: <tinfoil> Not saying it's a bad thing
1275593085: <tinfoil> just saying it's required for good planning
1275593117: <dp> $6 grand for a 2x Quadcore with 16G of RAM and 3 300G SAS drives
1275593122: <dp> seems awefully expensive
1275593257: <dp> $1500 more than the server we bought last year, that has higher cpu speed, but half the RAM
1275593590: <tinfoil> Ram is expensive
1275593726: <dp> just crazy
1275593740: <]3d0g> RAM is brutal
1275593961: <]3d0g> My cluster servers were $26K each, even with our massive discount.
1275594524: <dp> how much ram was that though?
1275594596: <]3d0g> 256
1275594654: <dp> yeah
1275594660: <dp> I'm looking for 16
1275595311: <]3d0g> 16 ain't legal in too many states ;-)
1275595663: <tinfoil> ]3d0g: I think it is where he lives

1275599823: <TeleCon> Total wtf
1275601783: <tinfoil> still waiting on confirmation from landlord
1275601785: <tinfoil> dammit
1275601798: <tinfoil> Think I'll call soon
1275601952: <tinfoil> No check deposited, ad still online
1275601985: <tinfoil> Been 45 hours since I handed him my deposit
1275602426: <acr0nym> Yeah, that's ridiculous.
1275603244: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
1275604833: <tinfoil> I did a little net stalking and checked up on him
1275604836: <tinfoil> so he's the real deal
1275604854: <tinfoil> At least it's not a scam
1275604864: <tinfoil> he just may be looking at other tennants, or isn't that attentive.
1275607620: <TeleCon> It's times like this it's hard to be Libertarian in regard to government regulating business.
1275607631: <TeleCon> Not that regs helped in any way.
1275609026: <tinfoil> Finally got confirmation.  :-)
1275609746: <milkchan> this is literally going to be standard oil all over again.  i doubt obama has the stones teddy roosevelt did.  
1275609779: <milkchan> my prediction is that the oil companies are going to jack the prices of gas and blame the off shore drilling ban for a crimp in supply
1275609794: <milkchan> even though new offshore drilling doesn't actually turn into consumable product for 10s of years
1275609893: <tinfoil> Not only that, but offshore drilling is what % of oil used (or to be used)?
1275609910: <tinfoil> milkchan: checkout http://twitter.com/bpglobalpr if you haven't yet
1275609929: <tinfoil> You will appreciate
1275609966: <milkchan> us oil production is only about 15-20% total usage
1275610089: <tinfoil> I'm amazed at how long it took me to convince fbx to check it out :-)
1275610464: <milkchan> i don't want to follow but i have been watching them from other sources
1275610467: <milkchan> http://eclecticbanana.tumblr.com/post/651159277/wings1295-aquaman-vs-bp-by-rob-kelly-the
1275610471: <milkchan> that's too fucking funny
1275610559: <tinfoil> I don't follow either, but it's fun to visit
1275610721: <milkchan> holy shit there's a ton of bp defenders that use proper grammar and punctuation.  that HAS to be paid astroturf
1275610734: <milkchan> it's just too smarmilly correct
1275610824: <tinfoil> oh?
1275611181: <tinfoil> http://gizmodo.com/5553765/are-cameras-the-new-guns
1275611714: <milkchan> you know i'll wager that there's a monitoring consent clause in police employment contracts
1275611745: <milkchan> defense should subpeona all employment contract materials for new hires and employee handbooks
1275611785: <milkchan> anything at all that says monitoring may occur - even if it's just in the weapons locker or car parks
1275611793: <milkchan> and that they consent to this monitoring
1275611817: <tinfoil> I have a feeling someone well funded will push this to the supreme court
1275611831: <tinfoil> I can't say they will win
1275611838: <milkchan> they wont
1275611843: <tinfoil> but in public, nobody has a reasonable expectation of privacy
1275611846: <milkchan> see all the really scary 5-4 decisions coming out?
1275611873: <tinfoil> Then again, that means that security cameras can't record police activity
1275611888: <milkchan> this latest one is a ripper - you do not have the right to remain silent unless you clearly STATE (by breaking your silence) you wish to affirm your right to remain silent
1275611924: <milkchan> sotomayor is probably the best thing to come out of the obama administration so far
1275612088: <tinfoil> While I'm completing my company's sexual harassment training quiz, I catch myself rubbernecking a hot co-worker as she passes my desk.
1275612092: <tinfoil> Such a nice ass on that one
1275612120: <milkchan> ahaha
1275612129: <milkchan> i thought you meant Justice Sotomayor
1275612140: <milkchan> i was gonna images.google.com real quick to see what i was missing
1275612224: <tinfoil> hahahah
1275612352: <tinfoil> ok, time to get the keys to my new apartment
1275612413: <milkchan> oh shit you got it?
1275613484: <TeleCon> milkchan: I was stunned at that decision.
1275613508: <TeleCon> However, it does clearly delineate, in a simple fashion, the line for cops.
1275613515: <TeleCon> Cops need to have it simple.
1275613555: <milkchan> simple was you had no consent or waiver of your miranda rights unless it was painfully and explicitly waived
1275613602: <milkchan> about the best video i ever watched was about how you simply never talk to the police.  ever. 
1275613615: <milkchan> this was a class given by a law prof
1275613631: <milkchan> with a major crimes detective giving a supporting talk
1275613663: <milkchan> the premesis is the police are professional (meaning trained) interrogators.  you're not a professional witness.  you say nothing other than "i do not waive my rights.  i would like a lawyer please"
1275613675: <milkchan> even simple traffic stops
1275613705: <milkchan> you say as little as possible because the cops will write down everything you said if it comes to trial
1275613723: <milkchan> the classic saying "i was doing 70?" in a 65 is admission of guilt right there
1275613777: <TeleCon> Yeah, I've seen the same video.
1275613799: <milkchan> i got a warning recently on the nj turnpike.  i was doing 90 in a 65
1275613805: <TeleCon> I also like the flexyourright.org videos.
1275613852: <milkchan> it's amazing how a clean, non ostentatious car, well dressed and groomed, and simple polite yes sir, no sirs will get you by
1275613957: <milkchan> The domain flexyourright.org may be for sale by its owner!
1275613971: <milkchan> think you dropped an s there
1275613985: <TeleCon> yea
1275613992: <TeleCon> flexyourrights
1275614019: <milkchan> got it
1275614035: <TeleCon> I always get away with whatever when I get pulled over by a state trooper.
1275614046: <TeleCon> City Cops seem to like to fuck me though.
1275614073: <TeleCon> I get more nervous when it is a city cop though.  Not sure why.
1275614092: <milkchan> local cops are a lot jumpier it seems
1275614096: <milkchan> less professional
1275614136: <TeleCon> Could be I've never pulled up in front of my house with 3 state troopers in full combat gear coming out of it.
1275614149: <TeleCon> :)
1275614173: <milkchan> we had a block party raided by cops out of uniform and refusing to show identification
1275614184: <milkchan> literally - a house party with neighbors there
1275614187: <milkchan> cops shut it down
1275614189: <TeleCon> I would have called 911 in that instance.
1275614200: <milkchan> we called 911, the state police, and the press
1275614204: <TeleCon> No ID == criminals in that case.
1275614232: <TeleCon> 911: Hello, what is your emergency?
1275614238: <milkchan> we got one of the neighbors kids to call 911 and claim armed men with no identification or badges broke in
1275614246: <milkchan> it turned into a riot
1275614260: <TeleCon> me: There are armed people pretending to be LEO's breaking into my house.
1275614281: <TeleCon> Any injuries?  What happened to the cops who wouldn't show id?
1275614303: <milkchan> there was one guy bounced off a beer keg that had to be hospitalized with a back injury
1275614307: <milkchan> and one minor maced
1275614339: <milkchan> the owners of the house and the neighbor's - the parent of the kid sued
1275614355: <milkchan> they barely broke even - all they managed to get was disciplinary letters filed on those cops
1275614358: <milkchan> no suspension
1275614359: <milkchan> no firing
1275614362: <milkchan> no criminal charges
1275614390: <TeleCon> figures.
1275614393: <TeleCon> Bastards.
1275614425: <TeleCon> Good thing no-one got shot in the incident.
1275614503: <milkchan> it was local cops being gung ho and not liking how they were told they were tresspassing on a legal gathering.  hell, they even filed with the clerk to find out about noise ordninances and let them know there was going to be a party that day
1275614576: <TeleCon> nice
1275614657: <milkchan> it took months to finally get all the charges dropped.  
1275614680: <milkchan> the band was lucky.  the cops assumed we were "hired help"
1275614684: <milkchan> and didn't try to process us
1275614757: <TeleCon> Sheesh
1275615312: <milkchan> The 9th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals clarified a passenger's right to travel without showing ID in its ruling in Gilmore v. Gonzales. Expecting that a TSA screening agent be able to parse a court opinion is often a losing battle. 
1275615317: * milkchan chortles
1275615500: <milkchan> If police persist in questioning you, repeat the magic words. The magic words are like a legal condom.  - this would all be funny if it wasn't so sad
1275615520: <TeleCon> Which vid?
1275615537: <milkchan> i'm just going through the flex faq
1275615547: <milkchan> ah yeah in the same section there's a link to the vid i was talking about
1275615547: <TeleCon> ah
1275615555: <TeleCon> cool
1275615564: <milkchan> probably the most important piece of advice to give a young person
1275615575: <milkchan> should show that every year until a kid graduates
1275616741: <TeleCon> Yep
1275616773: <TeleCon> I can totally see my kids saying, Fuck off, I gotta right to remain silent, gimmie a lawyer.
1275616784: <TeleCon> When asked for directions.
1275616924: <TeleCon> That's a pretty decent site

1275668252: <acr0nym> Actually, if I enable it under "Keyboard", it still doesn't appear to work...

1275673752: <]3d0g> OTOH, you could say: WOW, Sprint's really on the ball fixing the Evo SD issue so fast.
1275675304: <tinfoil> Hah
1275675309: <tinfoil> I never heard of it
1275675312: <tinfoil> was it a big deal?
1275675383: <tinfoil> Oh, I guess it is
1275675836: <tinfoil> It's a shame the first device had to be sprint
1275675882: <]3d0g> first device?
1275675888: <tinfoil> 4g handheld
1275675902: <]3d0g> well, there are no other 4G nets yet :)
1275675917: <tinfoil> Clearwire
1275675919: <tinfoil> :-p
1275675929: <]3d0g> which is sprint :)
1275675932: <tinfoil> but we're partners and they ARE using our network
1275675955: <tinfoil> We bought their 4g division a few years ago (xohm, I believe it was called)
1275675983: <]3d0g> Evo does look awesome. I'll get one if Sprint deploys in Denver this year like they claim
1275676157: <tinfoil> Sprint isn't deploying in Denver this year
1275676160: <tinfoil> but Clearwire is :-)
1275676166: <tinfoil> so sprint will be covered ;-)
1275676230: <]3d0g> they're effectively one and the same. Clearwire is the infrastructure, Sprint is the retail.
1275676278: <]3d0g> Sprint is the majority owner of Clear.
1275676294: <tinfoil> Yeah
1275676299: <tinfoil> I just like to be a pain in the ass
1275676335: <]3d0g> Remember, I work for a company that is a major owner of clear too. So, I know a few things :)
1275676369: <tinfoil> hehe
1275676378: <tinfoil> I admit to knowing shit.  :-0
1275676402: <tinfoil> I just know what they told me in orientation, but I have been keeping a loose tab on deployment
1275676415: <tinfoil> I know our coverage map is months out of date

1275683714: <TeleCon> Hopefully that's what is going on with data in this area, is an upgrade.

1275929998: <tinfoil> I could get was 3 blocks away
1275930014: <tinfoil> I plan on doing the big heavy items Sunday morning.
1275930054: <acr0nym> Wah, live in the suburbs, like a sane person, where you can drive right into your home.
1275930057: <acr0nym> ;)
1275930087: <tinfoil> I've seen people do that, it takes a lot of work to get the car out
1275930102: <acr0nym> I meant garage, asshole.
1275930470: <tinfoil> :-)
1275930497: <tinfoil> The benefit of this location?  It's part of one of the most major art-walks in the country :-)
1275930507: <tinfoil> So, it's worth it 
1275930653: <acr0nym> Heh, yeah, well.
1275930659: <dp> only if you care about art
1275930690: <acr0nym> And don't mind the thick smell of sharp cheese and crappy wine wafting up to you on elitism and snobbery.

1275930931: <tinfoil> Actually, I plan on having good wine and bad art
1275930937: <tinfoil> Sorry to say it, I'm not that good.  :-0
1275930950: <tinfoil> But I'll make up for it by having good wine (in my glass, at least)
1275931085: <ouiji> Don't worry tinfoil, I will let you borrow some of my pieces.. I have been described by some as being the next Picasso
1275931153: <ouiji> Granted those some.. may have been my mom and kindergarten teacher, yet.. I do not withdraw my statement

1275934993: <acr0nym> Oh, heh.  Well, I try.
1275935017: <acr0nym> I found the last "Art Walk" I was on fairly annoying.
1275935250: <tinfoil> It depends if you know people
1275935261: <tinfoil> That way you can compare how bad the art was with what they saw
1275935303: <tinfoil> So far, the pioneer square one is the only one I've been on that was worth a damn, but only when I know where to go BEFORE starting the walk

1275935806: <ouiji> anyone ever had the unfortunate task of trying to get Microshafts new "Silverlight" plugin to run in linux?
1275935899: <milkchan> you're trying this because you have to?
1275935940: <ouiji> yes
1275936002: <ouiji> The plugin says it installs just fine, but not a single silverlight based site recognizes it
1275936134: <milkchan> ever think the sites may be blocking non windows clients?
1275936226: <ouiji> Yes, I tried changing the HTTP request to say it was IE and not mozilla, and still no dice =/
1275936321: <ouiji> but I may have messed that up also. 
1275936387: <tinfoil> ouiji: Silverlight doesn't like wine/crossover office either
1275936399: <tinfoil> the solution is to install windows
1275936411: <tinfoil> Netflix going Silverlight was a huge mistake
1275936472: <ouiji> Yea, I really hate that. I Dropped my netflix account because of it
1275936494: <tinfoil> I just have a windows machine

1276006499: <milkchan> for the user profile page
1276006587: <milkchan> he contacted us informing us of intent to publish but didn't tell us what the issue was
1276006596: <milkchan> we had it figured out and patched in 24 hours
1276006607: <fbx> "go ahead and publish"
1276006615: <fbx> and don't tell him it's fixed already
1276006620: <fbx> fucker
1276006640: <fbx> that's black hat area, intent to publish without discovery
1276006659: <fbx> i assume there's a law against that somewhere....
1276006999: <ouiji> it is
1276007013: <ouiji> heh
1276007022: <ouiji> brings back memories 
1276007031: <milkchan> he soon had other legal issues to worry about 
1276007036: <milkchan> so we were in the clear
1276007103: <fbx> ding ding: spot on here:
1276007106: <fbx> Corporatism in all its ugly colors is on ready display in this disaster. The drilling used a single sleeve pipe instead of the stronger and less likely to leak double-walled version that is ordinarily used. They hurried the sealing of the well rather than cycle through the extra day necessary, worried about the fact that the well had already taken longer than intended, with each day costing thousands extra and the rig ready to move on. They apparently disregarded si
1276007196: <milkchan> did you read the kos diary on proper booming technique?
1276007216: <fbx> yes indeedy
1276007216: <milkchan> kos comments/community did more to turn me democrat than anything else
1276007246: <fbx> that story is worth a thousand (or million) MSM stories
1276007260: <milkchan> i still don't fucking like them, but i dislike them less than the moralist/religiousists 
1276007268: <fbx> and it's not proper booming, milkchan 
1276007279: <fbx> it's FUCKING PROPER FUCKING BOOMING
1276007299: <milkchan> which is why msm won't touch it.  he said "fuck" and disqualified himself
1276007353: <fbx> well, some kossacks think the govt is the answer, without realizing the answer they provide must be diligently extracted from them by We The People on a daily fucking basis. I'm not above stepping on their necks to be sure they're working for us.
1276007387: <]3d0g> Chinese orgies. Why bother? You're only going to be horny again in an hour.
1276007388: <milkchan> religions promote incompetence
1276007434: <fbx> I'm constantly amazed by the "Obama was going to change everything" crowd, though....he HIMSELF said "YOU are the change you're looking for, and you have to be that change every day, or we all fail." Some conveniently don't remember that.
1276007449: <milkchan> cream of sum yung guy less filling?
1276007527: <fbx> I have yet to leave my job and travel to DC to knock on doors, but I call and write on a regular basis. We all should.
1276007535: <fbx> Speak up, or get rolled.
1276007564: <]3d0g> I write e-mails to elected officials often. I'm sure they're ignored with vigor.

1276007603: <milkchan> corporate personhood violates my equal protection clause
1276007605: <fbx> I think I'll start sharing those letters with local news organizations so they too can ignore them with vigor.
1276007646: <]3d0g> fat guys are the solution to BP's problem?
1276007711: <ouiji> I thought it was better than their instructional video
1276007713: <]3d0g> ouiji: yawn. you're behind.
1276007726: <]3d0g> the hay idea was quickly dismissed.
1276007785: <]3d0g> 1: it doesn't float. 2: the poly-synthetic booms already used absorb more oil.
1276007795: <ouiji> so I guess what they say is true.. hay is just for horses
1276007859: <]3d0g> I wanna see tubby out in the ocean for the next 50 years beating the water with his wok strainer XD

1276008808: <fbx> start with DKos Booming School
1276008811: <fbx> go forward
1276008853: <fbx> he's funny and worth the read
1276008866: <fbx> and almost all that boom - according to him - is done wrong
1276008892: <fbx> i've found a few more actual booming experts who confirm what he says
1276008909: <fbx> not sure why MSM can't get those fucking folks on air somewhere
1276008954: <]3d0g> Granted, I've just skimmed those posts, but "fishgrease" isn't saying shit. (s)he's just ranting like the rest of us. 
1276008955: <milkchan> guy here has the 700ds lenovo
1276008958: <milkchan> thing is a boat
1276009004: <]3d0g> Oh, gotta click on "there's more"
1276009014: <fbx> yep
1276009150: <]3d0g> sorry, read Booming School I and II. obvious and pointless.
1276009243: <]3d0g> The real story here is BP cut corners at our behest. We all used the oil. We're all responsible. 
1276009300: <fbx> really? i didn't think the "this is how's it's supposed to be boomed" was obvious or pointless. if it is, why the fuck is BP instructing hundreds of folks on how to do it wrong? why the fuck is the USCG not correcting them at every turn?
1276009327: <]3d0g> Booms are a feel-good pointless exercise for public viewing.
1276009344: <]3d0g> Crude only stays on the surface for a short while.
1276009433: <acr0nym> Hah! http://www.boingboing.net/2010/06/07/sign-at-bp-gas-stati.html
1276009624: <]3d0g> $50 says this leak is still going on 6 months from now. Even a year wouldn't surprise me.
1276010225: <milkchan> is there something in the law or practice that says if you cap a well you lose your claim on it?
1276010250: <milkchan> i read somewhere that BP wouldn't cap the leak for fear of losing the rights to the oil there
1276010259: <milkchan> so they had to make a big show of failing
1276010434: <]3d0g> seems unlikely. I'm sure they've got the mineral rights leased from the US Gov.
1276010914: <fbx> ]3d0g: crude only stays on the surface a short while? where does it go after that?
1276010926: <fbx> ya know....being less dense than water and all...

1276012092: <fbx> nice link
1276012333: <]3d0g> One of the evening news shows went back to Prince William Sound. Over 20 years later, all they had to do was dig down about 2" to bring up oil. Americans need to get a clue. There is no "fixing" this. The damage will be permanent for our lifetimes, at least.
1276012430: <fbx> NBC did it a few weeks ago. I still say proper booming would lessen the impact, and improper booming isn't doing a goddamn thing.
1276012524: <]3d0g> Booms work when a boat springs a leak in its fuel tank. 200K+ gallons a day? NFW.
1276012541: <fbx> Agreed on fixing, however...fixing this entails alternative energy sources instead of petroleum. 
1276012558: <]3d0g> YES. And there's why people should be angry at Obama.
1276012584: <fbx> For not convincing Congress to change entirely?
1276012590: <]3d0g> Sign the build orders on a half dozen nuke reactors today.
1276012609: <TeleCon> Didn't someone post something about oil being subsidized to the tune of 550b?
1276012612: <fbx> OK, what standardized design will we be using? Where does the spent fuel go?
1276012635: <]3d0g> Ask the French. They're the masters.
1276012652: <]3d0g> Their pebble bed reactors sure look sweet.
1276012653: <fbx> Are you going to FORCE each electric company to accept "these 3 standardized designs"?
1276012675: <TeleCon> No
1276012686: <TeleCon> Let DOE build and run, and sell the energy.
1276012689: <]3d0g> yeah telecon. Subsidize electric cars and solar instead.
1276012693: <fbx> Sure...but how do you get Congress to enable that behavior? They aren't going to do it without incentive.
1276012729: <]3d0g> especially when THEIR incentive is presently coming from oil pocketbooks.
1276012745: <TeleCon> If they enable it, they get to stay elected.  Obama is fairly good at motivating the public.
1276012767: <fbx> Do you know the "OMFGBBQ!!!11ONE IT'S SOCIALISM!!!" bullshit that would result from that? Do you think that could realistically pass either Executive Order or into law through Congress?
1276012769: <]3d0g> except he seems to be missing the ball on this one.
1276012861: <fbx> Dude's out like 12 times in the last two months at alternative energy companies trying to nudge opinion towards acceptance. What exactly would you have him do otherwise?
1276012936: <fbx> your problem here isn't obama
1276012942: <fbx> it's the sheeple of the us
1276012961: <fbx> and assholes like me who commute long distances to work
1276013013: <]3d0g> Obama? Well, for one, he should quit trying to share the blame for this mess and put it squarely back on BP. Push legislation dropping the 75M liability cap - retroactively. Use this disaster as leverage against congress with a massive "go green" PR campaign. 
1276013091: <fbx> TeleCon: i've said for a long time now to change that subsidization: drop a penny for each gallon of petroleum or a dime per ton of coal and use that to subsidize greener methods (wind, solar, wave, etc)
1276013108: <fbx> ]3d0g: i think part of the blame is the Gov'ts
1276013166: <]3d0g> well of course it is. but reality is irrelevant in government. this is a PR and leverage opportunity Obama's squandering. 
1276013188: <TeleCon> Stop giving the oil indurstry 550 billion a year, and give it to tesla instead.
1276013189: <TeleCon> :)
1276013221: <fbx> having the MMS regulate the industries they are funded by is....is...is like having rating agencies paid to rate debt instruments directly by the folks offering said debt....oh.....wait....
1276013289: <fbx> personally, i'd start so much farther back from that it's almost completely unrelated
1276013347: <fbx> this is yet another symptom of a system that's easily an  openly funded by corporate persons who never die, and an election process that's ultimately unverifiable by the folks doing the voting.
1276013527: <fbx> change that, and de-codify the two party system, and we've really got something going!
1276013547: <fbx> all else is just a symptom
1276013672: <fbx> but yeah...we should do more with alternative sources and crack down on common energy sources and their environmental impact, even if that's only a symptom
1276013686: * fbx hands soapbox to TeleCon, ]3d0g 
1276013724: <TeleCon> End all energy subsidies, give the money back to the people and let the market decide.
1276013865: <fbx> i don't agree
1276013878: <]3d0g> I don't either. Used to. 
1276013884: <]3d0g> Market decisions lead to this mess.
1276013915: <fbx> that speaks as if the market isn't ruled by oligopolistic companies that have undue influence on the decisions. They do...overwhelmingly.
1276013951: <fbx> If we were all small and in perfect competition (or some semblence thereof), I'd agree fully
1276014012: <fbx> And markets aren't rational at all...they take such leverage seriously and overadjust accordingly
1276014229: <TeleCon> Level 2 flood alert on Boulder Creek.
1276014243: <]3d0g> LET'S GO TUBING!
1276014244: <acr0nym> Woop!
1276014248: <acr0nym> I think I get to go home at level 2.
1276014276: <TeleCon> Bridge collapsed up the Canyon, and created a dam.  They think at some point it will break.
1276014285: <acr0nym> Seriously?
1276014287: <acr0nym> Hrmm.
1276014288: <TeleCon> Yes.
1276014292: <TeleCon> hold a sec
1276014310: <TeleCon> Boulder Canyon: The bridge to the Red Lyon Inn has collapsed into the creek. Debris has created a dam, officials fearing a flash flood situation, Level 2 Flood Alert issued.
1276014334: <acr0nym> Hoooh, harsh.
1276014345: <TeleCon> Yeah
1276014435: <acr0nym> Dammit, I don't know if I'm in an Evacuation group.
1276014457: <acr0nym> Ah, fuck, it also only applies to the Computing Center.  Bah.
1276014458: <acr0nym> Heh.
1276014475: <]3d0g> I'm pretty sure you're tagged to go down with the ship.
1276014484: <acr0nym> BullSHIT.
1276014488: <TeleCon> lol
1276014494: <acr0nym> I'm one of the rats that TELL you it's sinking!
1276014503: <TeleCon> I don't think any state classified staff is called upon to do that.
1276014547: <acr0nym> Heh, a bunch of 36 out of town, though, is in the "FEMA 100 year floodplain".
1276014550: <acr0nym> That'd be AWESOME.
1276014561: <TeleCon> Head through Longmont.
1276014570: <acr0nym> Going that way would be worse.
1276014585: <TeleCon> I just got the Wunderground flood notice.

1276015082: <TeleCon> I need some coffee.
1276015148: <TeleCon> got it
1276015177: <TeleCon> Good thing I'm already at the place with the best coffee in town.
1276015259: <acr0nym> Where?
1276015707: <TeleCon> my house

1276019592: <]3d0g> Released moments ago. Fresh material for Anna Telecon: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niqrrmev4mA
1276019697: <fbx> her videos are pretty swank
1276019740: <]3d0g> she's single-handedly made music videos interesting again IMO. You could spend days interpreting that shit.
1276019779: <fbx> hrm...two days watching guys in fishnets? prolly not...but they are interesting and worth a few looks.
1276019803: <]3d0g> though this one clearly demonstrates the inherent fugliness of Jersey girls XD
1276019813: <fbx> ouch
1276019815: <fbx> wrong
1276019826: <fbx> well, mean, anyway
1276019875: <acr0nym> I think of Lady Gaga as Madonna 2.0.
1276019876: <]3d0g> hey, you know I'm right. Fantastic bod, but man, that Jersey look is unmistakable. 
1276019882: <]3d0g> Definitely acr0.
1276019887: <acr0nym> One wonders what weird religion she'll end up in.
1276019897: <acr0nym> I'm guessing Scientology, based on the Scifi crap.
1276019916: <fbx> actually, i wonder if she'll be that successful. madonna was a goddamn force to be reckoned with.
1276019918: <]3d0g> They OK with dry-humping homos?
1276019930: <acr0nym> Ask Katie Holmes....
1276019935: <TeleCon> lol
1276019937: <]3d0g> I'll put money on her surpassing Madonna fbx.
1276019938: <fbx> she may start her own recording company and end up owning all her masters, but we'll see
1276019942: <TeleCon> Or ask matt and trey
1276019949: <]3d0g> heh
1276019954: <acr0nym> fbx: Actually, me, too.
1276020010: <fbx> i wish her all the luck, but it's still an industry heavily slanted towards the recording companies
1276020087: <fbx> the machine gun tits are awesome, however
1276020089: <]3d0g> yeah, and she's one of their precious few successes these days. They need her far more than she needs them.
1276020092: <fbx> near the end of the video

1276020103: <fbx> that's hot

1276020142: <fbx> i may bookface that
1276020146: <]3d0g> yeah, her best yet, IMO

1276020173: <fbx> truth, my friend
1276020184: <]3d0g> At least do it in 1080p and look for the nip slip at 6:10

1276020195: <fbx> excellent!
1276020222: <fbx> yep...hard to see, though
1276020345: <fbx> thought easy to spot on a 23" monitor in 1080 fullscreen
1276020368: <]3d0g> youtube's 1080p is impressive. 
1276020426: <acr0nym> The real shame of it is just how bad the "music" part of it is.

1276022536: <tinfoil> No idea who he was
1276022542: <tinfoil> "some kid" in my book
1276022558: <tinfoil> I'll admit the cinematography looks very good
1276022565: <tinfoil> I might watch it for that
1276022618: <acr0nym> Heh, I will undoubtedly illegally download it at some damn point.
1276022637: <tinfoil> You?
1276022640: <tinfoil> Illegal?
1276022647: <tinfoil> Never woulda thunk
1276022698: <acr0nym> I know, right?
1276022700: <milkchan> which reminds me: i need to get acro an ssh account again so i can live vicariously off his illegal data consumption
1276022748: <tinfoil> Wow, the ipad is THAT expensive?
1276022755: <tinfoil> I never looked up how much they cost
1276022763: <tinfoil> Surprised they are that popular
1276022767: <tinfoil> I'd rather get a netbook
1276022790: <acr0nym> Seriously.
1276022794: <milkchan> something that can run linux, multitask, etc
1276022801: <tinfoil> little things...
1276022809: <milkchan> good song
1276022813: <milkchan> well cept for the lyrics
1276022834: <]3d0g> the two things the iPad has going for it is the instant on and crazy battery life.
1276022880: <milkchan> at&t dataplans are a big selling point too
1276022884: <acr0nym> Hah.
1276022886: <acr0nym> Nice.
1276022926: <]3d0g> I suspect the Apple ATT marriage ends in < 6 months.
1276022988: <milkchan> didn't they say that 6 months ago?
1276023013: <milkchan> didn't jobs tout the cheap unlimited data plans the ipad would come with?
1276023023: <]3d0g> and ATT fucked him.
1276023039: <milkchan> yah.  i am SO glad i jumped at&t
1276023047: <]3d0g> Now ATT is "offering" early upgrades to iPhone 4. Why?
1276023105: <milkchan> tmobile + clearwire/sprint has served me pretty well so far
1276023139: <milkchan> can't get a tmobile signal in the building here so both the laptop and the nexus are going over the clearspot
1276023284: <milkchan> are european gsm 3g frequencies the same as domestic tmobile or at&t?
1276023652: <]3d0g> yurp and yank GSM frequencies are different.
1276023661: <]3d0g> hence tri and quad-mode phones.
1276023803: <tinfoil> Nothing like standards
1276023859: <fbx> that's some fine Wing Chun and Wushu that "Karate" Kid is doing
1276023880: <]3d0g> I quite liked Wang Chung.
1276023894: <fbx> i get the franchise argument, ok, but....really? That's Kung Fu, folks. Not even the same continent.
1276023906: <fbx> fine. Ving Tsun, then?
1276023928: <fbx> my friends make the same joke
1276023935: <fbx> "what martial art do you study?"
1276023940: <fbx> "wing chun"
1276023956: <fbx> "oh...i didn't know they named a martial art after a band"
1276023956: <fbx> har
1276024002: <]3d0g> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoXu6QmxpJE
1276024007: <fbx> no
1276024015: <fbx> it's a wang chung video, and i'm not clicking
1276024016: <fbx> ;)
1276024031: <]3d0g> But it reeks of 80s awesomeness.
1276024115: <fbx> the move he pushes jackie chan back with in the promo (two hands waist high pushing out)...called a gum sao
1276024119: <fbx> pinning hand
1276024130: <]3d0g> As I recall, those guys still make loads of bank doing movie soundtracks.
1276024251: <fbx> take your baby by the hand
1276024288: <fbx> something about a handstand
1276024291: <fbx> i don't rememeber
1276024295: <fbx> or remember
1276024307: <milkchan> sweep the leg johnny = good band
1276024527: <tinfoil> I've been listening to a lot of "fukkk offf" lately - great heavy electro
1276026499: * tinfoil shakes his bootay
1276027114: <TeleCon> fbx: I have been kind of posty, haven't it.
1276027119: <TeleCon> s/it/I/
1276027211: <]3d0g> FB whore.
1276027224: <TeleCon> Hey, someone just robbed a bank in Greenwood Village.
1276027238: <TeleCon> ]3d0g: It's just so easy to click the share button while google reading.
1276027255: <]3d0g> Not on Arapahoe, I hope.
1276027388: <TeleCon> Greenwood Village: 9600 blk of East Arapahoe Road, bank robbery with a bolo issued for a gray cadillac. O/F DTRS & Online 199
1276027408: <TeleCon> Why?
1276027417: <]3d0g> great. heading to our Peakview facility momentarily. 
1276027427: <TeleCon> Oh, traffic issues.
1276027445: <]3d0g> cops love to fuck up traffic.
1276027465: <TeleCon> s/traffic/everything/
1276027543: <TeleCon> or s/fu.$/abuse power./
1276027562: <TeleCon> That's not a nun, she's wearing make up.
1276027589: <TeleCon> OK, Anna can listen to Lady Gaga, just not watch her viddies.
1276027626: <TeleCon> That song isn't as good as telephone though.
1276027719: <]3d0g> It's catchy but not her best. Is her best vid tho IMO.
1276027728: <acr0nym> How 'bout the power to kill a yak, from 200 yards away, with MIND BULLETS?
1276027734: <acr0nym> That's telekinesis, Kyle!
1276027747: <TeleCon> Ha.
1276027764: <TeleCon> Just started watching "Men who Stare at Goats" lasat night.
1276027824: <TeleCon> The fact that I like telephone better could be a sign of the "phreak" within though.
1276027855: <]3d0g> well, that and Byonce's boobies.
1276027927: <TeleCon> Beyonce is in that?
1276027961: <]3d0g> uuuh, yeah :) Telephone was a joint song.
1276028046: <TeleCon> I'll go watch the video again.  BTW, fuck a bunch of flash for not handling 1080p very well.
1276028182: <acr0nym> I canNOT take it anymore: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5VLN7CAf0I
1276028240: <TeleCon> why?
1276028259: <acr0nym> I tried the Lady Gaga thing for a few minutes.
1276028263: <TeleCon> Ah
1276028265: <TeleCon> gotcha
1276028269: <acr0nym> Oh, that video was my response.  Heh.
1276028270: <TeleCon> This is the antidote
1276028297: <]3d0g> Don't make me dig up an Erasure vid...
1276028303: <TeleCon> That's a good antidote, actually.
1276028311: <acr0nym> Dude, that Warm Leatherette cover kicks ass.
1276028322: <]3d0g> that was good, actually.
1276028389: <acr0nym> I rather want a KAOSS pad.
1276028398: <acr0nym> I have no excuse for one, but, I want it nonetheless.
1276028415: <TeleCon> Now which one is Trent?
1276028434: <TeleCon> the second vocalist?
1276028435: <acr0nym> He's on the minimoog.
1276028441: <TeleCon> Yeah
1276028448: <TeleCon> The Timmah looking guy is?
1276028452: <acr0nym> Heh, yep.
1276028466: <acr0nym> Which sorta explains why I've always said Timmah looks like Trent....
1276028471: <TeleCon> Oh no
1276028482: <TeleCon> The guitarist looks more like Timmah than trent.
1276028502: <acr0nym> Well, when Trent and Timmay both had more hair....
1276028515: <TeleCon> Ah
1276028522: <acr0nym> http://scrapetv.com/News/News%20Pages/Technology/images/Trent-Reznor.jpg
1276028563: <acr0nym> For example.
1276028623: <TeleCon> Ah
1276028627: <TeleCon> Yeah
1276028665: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
1276028676: <TeleCon> Isn't "Afraid of Americans" a Bowie song?
1276028779: <acr0nym> Yes.
1276028792: <TeleCon> Hot
1276028799: <TeleCon> NIN does Cars
1276028814: <TeleCon> I like that version even better than the Fear Factory version.
1276029069: <acr0nym> Yeah, he does quite a bit of Gary Numan, actually.
1276029110: <TeleCon> He's another I am glad I got to see live at least once.
1276029157: <acr0nym> I'm not sure I've heard the Fear Factory version, actually.
1276029187: <acr0nym> Quick, what did Gary Numan for his lengthy hiatus from music?
1276029194: <TeleCon> No idea
1276029201: <acr0nym> test pilot for experimental aircraft.
1276029205: <TeleCon> nice
1276030370: <ouiji> I wonder if there is a statute of limitations on website defacement..
1276030433: <ouiji> Cause if there is, I should go pull my old works of art of the attrition mirror
1276030455: <ouiji> s and write a book about it and go hang out with mitnik and gandolf 
1276030644: <tinfoil> I never comitted crimes, so nothing to talk about.
1276030653: <tinfoil> It's probably a safe thing to do.  IMHO.
1276030688: <tinfoil> Of course, I never tried drugs either
1276030715: <ouiji> heh
1276030817: <ouiji> well even if such things did exist, I highly doubt there would be a single one that had any content on it I would be willing to admit to being the creator of
1276030986: <tinfoil> heheh
1276030995: <tinfoil> Ever play with hackthissite.org?
1276030998: <tinfoil> It's fun
1276031018: <tinfoil> A friend of mine said he'd create accounts and give them to people who were interviewing at his company
1276031027: <tinfoil> to measure their skill
1276031082: <ouiji> never actually looked at it, any good?
1276031101: <tinfoil> It's pretty good
1276031120: <tinfoil> I completed like 2/3 of the web tests within 8 hours
1276031131: <tinfoil> I forced myself to stop... it was addictive
1276031153: <tinfoil> the harder tests were fairly hard, multi-stage attacks
1276031255: <tinfoil> It helps knowing a little perl, php, sql, html and javascript
1276031303: <ouiji> sounds kind of fun, I really haven't delved into that world in quite some time, could be fun
1276031454: <tinfoil> If you're unemployed it could be good to keep you sharp
1276031474: <tinfoil> Also, keep track of when you created your account and how long it takes you to complete each challenge (start-end)
1276031483: <tinfoil> It might be good for a pen-test interview
1276031489: <ouiji> I think the last time I actually spent any amount of time thinking something like that through in a non professional capacity was back when my black Dell 8100 with the yellow front pieces was top of the line :-p
1276031494: <tinfoil> At least enough to start a conversation
1276031520: <milkchan> yellow codpieces attract eyeballs
1276031537: <ouiji> I think i'll do that
1276031624: <tinfoil> Two things you need to do while unemployed:  A) Keep your skills sharp,  B) Have lots of fun (while keeping it low budget) - else you'll regret it
1276031628: <tinfoil> :-)
1276031780: <ouiji> I hear ya, I am just thanking my lucky stars that I didn't trade in my beemer on a new 335xi. I was literally a week away from going ahead with it when I got notice I was going to be laid off, along with half my department  
1276031912: <ouiji> I would really be upside down and hung out to dry then

1276110380: <tinfoil> it was there the whole time
1276110428: <tinfoil> Wheee!
1276110441: <tinfoil> Ok, I'm sold on Google chrome

1276110479: <TeleCon> Yeah
1276110481: <dp> nice
1276110490: <tinfoil> wait
1276110497: <ouiji> Chrome is great, except the fact that you can't customize it for shit
1276110498: <tinfoil> nice!
1276110508: <tinfoil> I installed adblock without issue
1276110510: <dp> ouiji: I've customized mine enough for me
1276110531: <acr0nym> TeleCon: luck....
1276110543: <dp> tinfoil: make sure to get the adblock options thingy, so that you get a button in the menubar

1276111112: <TeleCon> Which makes it more intimidating, but ....
1276111399: <tinfoil> The question is - why are two leaving at the same time?
1276111592: <ouiji> wow, the extensions for chrome have like tripled since I last looked 
1276111810: <TeleCon> They both need a change.
1276111821: <TeleCon> They're both friends, so I will talk to them as well.
1276112692: <ouiji> Wow.. opening gmail in chrome shot CPU to 98% overloading Xorg, Chrome, and php

1276114687: <dp> our CEO is giving us grief
1276114692: <dp> because we want to buy 2 servers
1276114707: <dp> because "we didn't plan ahead for this"
1276114737: <tinfoil> wHY NOT?
1276114740: <tinfoil> Whoops
1276114740: <tinfoil> Why not?
1276114818: <dp> why not what?
1276114935: <tinfoil> What did you plan ahead?
1276114937: <tinfoil> err
1276114937: <tinfoil> why
1276114941: <tinfoil> didn't
1276115173: <tinfoil> I'm not being a pain in the ass, just curious
1276115324: <tinfoil> Cute, analytics works better in firefox than chrome
1276115817: <dp> because we launched a new site, and at the same time, switched to a new analytics program
1276115824: <dp> both of which are running on current hardware

1276193903: <tinfoil> Wow, officially 6 months and I'm still getting hate mail
1276193912: <tinfoil> we only dated 3 months, and I never stuck my cock in her
1276193954: <ouiji> and I thought my choice in chicks was bad
1276193966: <tinfoil> No, this one was particularly bad
1276193980: <tinfoil> My main squeeze is pretty awesome though
1276194024: <ouiji> Threats from fathers, older siblings.. but never hate mail.. Damn man, I am impressed
1276194025: <tinfoil> ouiji:  Been to my website yet?  You might enjoy some of the content
1276194038: <ouiji> I don't believe so, address?
1276194051: <tinfoil> Hate mail 6 months after we broke up from 3 months of dating.
1276194063: <tinfoil> some of it from different accounts
1276194066: <tinfoil> she stalks me
1276194107: <ouiji> wow, you must have really made an impression
1276194247: <dp> ouiji: sinisterbrain.net, IIRC
1276194263: <dp> tinfoil: tell her you're reporting her to the authorities

1276194423: <tinfoil> My one problem with distributed freeware NoSQL is that so far all of them replicate the entire database across all servers
1276194470: <tinfoil> Ideally, it should spread like RAID, so you have some redundancy, but also more storage
1276194960: <ouiji> tinfoil: I like the site. I guess one could say that the creator of your hatemail is still a bit bound to you
1276194989: <tinfoil> the hatemail person has nothing to do with mywebsite (not posted on it either)
1276195016: <tinfoil> But she's known for being obsessive against anyone she percives as wronged her
1276195028: <tinfoil> It's known to last indefinatly
1276195044: <tinfoil> I found this out after I started dating her
1276195189: <ouiji> Thats always a bummer to find out afterwords

1276195538: <tinfoil> milkchan: They made a new karate kid, staring Jackie Chan - Comes out this friday.
1276195566: <milkchan> is jackie chan playing someone japanese?
1276195574: <acr0nym> No, it's in China.
1276195580: <milkchan> ok fair enough
1276195590: <ouiji> And will smith's son is playing Dr.DreSon
1276195602: <milkchan> if it was a direct remake, i would have questioned the casting
1276195610: <milkchan> of jackie.  who cares if the kid is black
1276195645: <tinfoil> The cinematography looks pretty good, so I'll likely end up seeing it at some point.  The story on the other hand... *twitch*
1276195652: <tinfoil> might be worse than the first
1276195673: <tinfoil> At least the antagonest in the first one had really horribly bad martial arts skills 
1276195688: <ouiji> The Great Black Ninja
1276195690: <tinfoil> The new one, they are surprisingly good.

1276195898: <milkchan> isn't it kung fu in china?

1276195960: <dp> doesn't make it good
1276195965: <dp> just gives you a reference point
1276196010: <milkchan> is epert a person or a site?
1276196031: <dp> shit, ebert
1276196036: <dp> I knew that ddidn't look right
1276196037: <milkchan> what's that, epert?  i can't hear you.  i've got a banana in my ear.
1276196058: <dp> what's that epert? I can't hear you.  Your jaw is missing

1276197390: <dp> did you see the Vampire's Apprentice?
1276197394: <dp> IIRC, it's along the same lines
1276197403: <acr0nym> No, thanks for reminding me....
1276197408: <acr0nym> I want to see it.  Heh.
1276197411: <dp> or, maybe not
1276197427: <dp> but yeah, it's actually pretty good
1276197453: <dp> ok, I *REFUSE* TO SEE GET HIM TO THE GREEK! STOP ADVERTISING IT!
1276197481: <dp> Jonah Hill annoys the piss out of me, and Russell Brand is even worse
1276198284: <acr0nym> Woop.  Cirque du Freak downloading now.
1276198285: <acr0nym> Heh.
1276198378: <dp> lol
1276198384: <dp> apparently, there's a book series
1276199169: <dp> I'm done with today
1276199194: <ouiji> That Sorcerers Apprentice movie looks half decent, eventhough I despise Nicolas cage
1276199284: <acr0nym> Them's fightin' words, boy.
1276199338: <ouiji> Sorry, but my respect for him was gone in 60 seconds. One might say... it kind of tore his face off
1276199414: <acr0nym> Right.  Because you've never taken a retarded job....
1276199463: <acr0nym> It doesn't make YOU a ...  wait, never mind.
1276199484: <ouiji> heh touché
1276199500: <acr0nym> I think in your case, it's just a false correlation.
1276199517: <acr0nym> Retarded AND you get retarded jobs!
1276199643: <ouiji> His acting in gone in 60 seconds, was just catastrophic. But I do like quite a few of his other movies.  
1276199833: <dp> how good does your acting have to be to be on screen with Angelina Jolie?
1276199840: <tinfoil> Nocolas cage is a fun actor with a randomly good choice in movies
1276199841: <dp> now, Robert Duvall is another story
1276199925: <]3d0g> Hey, Gone in 60 is a perfectly watchable flick.
1276199946: <acr0nym> I agree.
1276199971: <tinfoil> Man, redhat annoys me with their back-patching methodology
1276200053: <tinfoil> To install ruby on rails on redhat 64bit you have to build ruby from scratch... why?   Because the ruby version supplied with redhat is severely out of date
1276200090: <]3d0g> yeah, ran into that one here. RH is a conservative distro. deal.
1276200126: <]3d0g> It *is* a shame ruby ain't in EPEL.
1276200149: <dp> yay.  next week, I get to roll my CD over, and I'm gonna add at least $100 to it
1276200157: <dp> gotta keep us from touching that money somehow
1276200174: <]3d0g> give it to us. we'll keep it away
1276200184: <dp> gotta keep it "safe" too ;)
1276200234: <tinfoil> It'll be safe
1276200248: <]3d0g> we'll stimulate the economy with it.
1276200249: <tinfoil> ]3d0g won't harm the money in any way
1276202600: <tinfoil> Ok, ruby 1.9 installed by hand, everyone else fell into place
1276202748: <acr0nym> What the FUCK.  It's only Thursday?
1276202804: <tinfoil> yeah
1276202806: <tinfoil> you think it's friday?
1276202816: <acr0nym> Bah, I dunno what I thought.
1276202955: <acr0nym> I probably did, indeed, think it was Friday, given how annoyed I was to realize that there's another day this week.
1276203038: <]3d0g> we can take a vote. declare it Friday.
1276203045: <acr0nym> Jeebus, I wish.
1276203056: <]3d0g> Have a little faith in democracy. 
1276203089: <acr0nym> Democracy in this instance will fail for the same reasons it does elsewhere....  To many idiots voting.
1276203092: <acr0nym> Too many, even.

1276204475: <acr0nym> Hrmm, I've been thinking about a facial hair project.....

1276204580: <acr0nym> Riiiight, because that page says "Stranahans Colorado Tequila"?  ;)
1276204602: <acr0nym> Or, realistically, "Stranahans Colorado Mezcal"
1276204603: <]3d0g> Last I checked, the Captain ain't pouring agave either :)
1276204636: <acr0nym> Yeah, but, that was more of a joke than anything.
1276204642: <acr0nym> I can't remember the last time I had rum.
1276204722: <]3d0g> Pop a few collars and pour yourself some Patrón.
1276204816: <acr0nym> What have collars got to do with it?  And, I have another brand I vastly prefer if I'm gonna get into that range.
1276204835: <]3d0g> It's the preferred drink of Jersey douches.

1276209494: <tinfoil> Wow, I'm amazed when people don't 'get' group permissions on unix
1276209520: <tinfoil> So we have a service account.  First the developers wanted login access to the service account
1276209536: <tinfoil> and for the service account to have sudo privs
1276209543: <tinfoil> which every developer would know the password for
1276209549: <tinfoil> we nixed that
1276209569: <tinfoil> now they want all the developers to have logins/sudo on the prod servers
1276209573: <tinfoil> We investigated why...
1276209582: <tinfoil> they need to transfer files to the service
1276209586: <tinfoil> nothing more
1276209603: <tinfoil> I explained group permissions and I was met with a blank stare
1276209633: <tinfoil> Really, if I were able, I'd fire most of them
1276209710: <tinfoil> If you don't understand group permissions you don't deserve sudo access either.
1276210286: <tinfoil> Whoop the manager understood
1276210287: <tinfoil> :-)
1276211960: <TeleCon> rock

1276619802: <dp> snapped
1276619945: <milkchan> you snapped it off in the girl in the dress?
1276619950: <dp> yes
1276619953: <milkchan> woot
1276619954: <milkchan> kinky
1276620621: <TeleCon> That tmo deal is for moving to a family plan.
1276620645: <TeleCon> I haven't seen the N1 in stores yet, but the Slide seems snappy
1276621137: <]3d0g> I've got no plan so I could do that.
1276621331: <milkchan> the 139 unlimited everything family plan is really about 155 once all the taxes and fees get attached
1276621390: <dp> ok.  I want a *super* lightweight mail client, that has plugin capabilities
1276621393: <dp> suggestions?
1276621397: <TeleCon> 1500 minutes seems to be enough voice time for the wife and I.
1276621404: <milkchan> which is blissfully better than sitting around and waiting for AT&T to fuck me in the ass for overages
1276622084: <milkchan> why the fuck are they comparing anything bill gates says to eintstein?
1276622228: <fbx> cuz einstein stole everything from tesla like bill stole everything from steve
1276622231: <fbx> hrm
1276622235: <fbx> i could be wrong
1276622285: <milkchan> oO

1276629880: <dp> anyone here running gnome on ubuntu?
1276631289: <dp> nm
1276631301: <dp> looks like I just have to keep reinstalling packages till I get everything
1276631612: <milkchan> sounds like the old rpm behavior :P
1276633548: <dp> I downgraded ubuntu
1276633553: <dp> and lots of stuff disappeared
1276634077: <acr0nym> I totally want this job: http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/rent-a-white-guy/8119
1276634240: <TeleCon> dp: try apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop
1276634268: <acr0nym> THIS is funny: http://www.ustream.tv/devo
1276634388: <TeleCon> strange
1276634441: <dp> TeleCon: I've done that
1276634452: <dp> at this point, I'm reinstalling all 2300 packages on the system
1276634488: <TeleCon> yikes
1276634544: <dp> downloading is gonna take ~20 minutes
1276634680: <dp> if they'd fucking fix apt so that it could download from multiple source simultaneously, it would be a lot faster
1276635440: <dp> wewt...
1276635462: <dp> dpkg -l | grep ^ii | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -I{} apt-get --reinstall -y install {}
1276635468: <dp> reinstall every package on the box
1276637805: <milkchan> headless chickens are more secure
1276637893: <]3d0g> lazy linux inquiry - what editors can do block selects?
1276637912: <]3d0g> like to strip columns of whitespace from a file
1276638120: <milkchan> gnumeric?  ;)
1276638625: <]3d0g> spaced vim.
1276638636: <]3d0g> tired.
1276640212: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
1276644468: <dp> milkchan: secure? eh?
1276653140: <milkchan> what's secure?
1276691944: <dp> [17:36]  milkchan| headless chickens are more secure
1276691951: <dp> trying to understand what you mean by that statement
1276693052: <fbx> ok, back in a while. installing a new router/switch to test new T1s
1276693226: <dp> have fun ;)
1276695978: <dp> yay.  got messages in the spam folder automagically being taught to sa-learn
1276696000: <dp> got spams in the /new folder older than 10 days going to the /cur folder for processing
1276696009: <dp> got spams in the /cur folder older than 30 days being baleeted
1276696016: <dp> automation is a good thing!
1276696019: <dp> TM
1276698930: <milkchan> headless chickens are just harder to hack
1276698944: <milkchan> being all... headless and all
1276698981: <dp> ....
1276698982: <dp> mk
1276698990: <dp> what did that have to do with me upgrading packages?
1276699057: <milkchan> absolutely nothing
1276699060: <dp> k
1276699062: <milkchan> and you're downgrading
1276699064: <milkchan> i thought
1276699070: <dp> well
1276699074: <dp> I did downgrade
1276699082: <dp> but now I'm reinstalling all of the packages on the system
1276699168: <milkchan> seems like a lot of work
1276699177: <dp> not for me
1276699258: <dp> I need more screenspace
1276701357: --> ]3d0g (jkarp@6988929A.F4AE6A51.BF63E968.IP) has joined #lobby
1276701357: <PipSqueek> ]3d0g: Prost!
1276703555: <acr0nym> Yeah...  This guy's credible: http://www.boingboing.net/2010/06/16/spotted-bigfoot-with.html
1276704209: --- acr0nym has changed the topic to: "If computers get too powerful, we can organize them into a committee -- that will do them in." -- Bradley's Bromide

1276706967: <dp> acr0nym: yep.  that's happened a lot
1276706974: <dp> hence why I'm reinstalling everything
1276710264: <acr0nym> Huh.  One of the stranger videos I've seen, certainly today: http://www.boingboing.net/2010/06/16/history-of-the-typew.html
1276712233: <dp> woot... passing totem
1276714981: <dp> passing the xserver packages!
1276715471: <]3d0g> long as you aren't passing gas
1276715564: <]3d0g> acr0nym - when you arriving in LAS for DC?
1276715581: <acr0nym> Tuesday, 7/27, why?
1276715592: <]3d0g> wow, early, no?
1276715608: <acr0nym> Well, not since I am working as a speaker proctor for the Black Hat Briefings.
1276715619: <acr0nym> And, no, it wouldn't be early if you were to be going to Security B Sides LV.
1276715621: <]3d0g> this I did not now
1276715623: <]3d0g> know
1276715641: <acr0nym> Yep.  It's festive.
1276715641: <acr0nym> Heh.
1276715648: <]3d0g> so when should *I* be there?
1276715679: <acr0nym> Umm, it depends on if you're interested in BsidesLV: http://www.securitybsides.com/BSidesLasVegas
1276715690: <acr0nym> If you're not, Thursday night should be fine, this year.

1276717221: <acr0nym> When you gonna be there?
1276717223: <acr0nym> :)
1276717241: <]3d0g> early thurs. leave early mon.
1276717268: <acr0nym> Good, good.
1276717424: <]3d0g> When's Delchi's shindig?
1276717443: <acr0nym> Uh, I wanna say Friday night.
1276717447: <]3d0g> good
1276717523: <acr0nym> Is the mayor comin' this year?
1276717527: <]3d0g> yup
1276717533: <acr0nym> Heh, nice.
1276717569: <acr0nym> You're a Joss freak, you might dig this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM3Hme36g0s&feature=player_embedded#!
1276717614: <acr0nym> Oh, yeah, here: http://www.facebook.com/#!/photo.php?pid=4075966&o=all&op=1&view=all&subj=119079184787833&aid=-1&id=564909294
1276717618: <acr0nym> Friday, 7/30.
1276717667: <]3d0g> Dare I ask where he gets the coin for this?
1276717694: <acr0nym> Uh...
1276717708: <dp> must be a member to view!~
1276717714: <acr0nym> It's AR and OC related.....  I dunno the funding for them.
1276717719: <acr0nym> dp: correct.  ;)
1276717725: <acr0nym> ]3d0g is a member....  Heh.
1276717733: <]3d0g> interesting. as is Delchi :)
1276717778: <acr0nym> Indeed....
1276717783: <acr0nym> Sure wish he could find a job!
1276717783: <acr0nym> Heh.
1276717793: <]3d0g> hence my inquiry :)
1276717815: <acr0nym> I'm not entirely clear on the funding for/of AttackResearch.
1276717853: <acr0nym> So, you seriously gonna be done with the Tap-a-Draft in a few days?
1276717883: <]3d0g> umm, pretty much now as my fridge bit the dust last night.
1276717959: <]3d0g> had to empty out the fermentation fridge in the garage as well as the kegerator this morning to save the $250 worth of grub we'd just bought last weekend.
1276718035: <]3d0g> got a time this week you'd like to meet up?
1276718122: <acr0nym> Your homestead, or wanna bring it to work?
1276718135: <acr0nym> And, bummer about the fridge!
1276718163: <]3d0g> I can bring it in. Got 7 1.5 gal bottles so it's relatively space intensive.
1276718217: <acr0nym> Umm....  Hrm.  Tomorrow, I could mebbe pull it off.  Friday, I'm doing the Security Bsides thing in Denver.
1276718234: <acr0nym> I assume I've gotta clean out my car completely, 'cuz you're gonna force a big pile of switches on me, right?
1276718245: <]3d0g> was just about to ask.
1276718252: <acr0nym> Heh.
1276718258: <acr0nym> I can prolly take 'em, at the same time.
1276718289: <]3d0g> have a look while you're here anyway. maybe you don't want to mess with the really old ones.
1276718302: <acr0nym> Ah, we'll do SOMETHING with 'em.
1276718304: <acr0nym> Heh.  
1276718307: <acr0nym> How many are there?
1276718316: <]3d0g> 3
1276718324: <acr0nym> Oh, that should be okay.
1276718328: <]3d0g> one of newer vintage
1276718336: <acr0nym> My car is actually pretty empty, anyway.
1276718342: <]3d0g> tomorrow it is
1276718354: <acr0nym> A'ight.
1276718366: <acr0nym> Tomorrow is Wings day, right?
1276718373: <acr0nym> Or, is that just one Thursday a month?
1276718455: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: Seen this?  http://www.boingboing.net/2010/06/16/e3-2010-first-gamepl.html
1276718459: <acr0nym> Portal 2 video....
1276718459: <]3d0g> no, it should be tomorrow
1276718460: <acr0nym> Heh.
1276718480: <acr0nym> A'ight, remind me in the morning...  I'll try to join for wings....
1276718481: <acr0nym> Heh.
1276718485: <]3d0g> yeah, watched that live during Sony's E3 yesterday
1276718491: <]3d0g> I came a little
1276718491: <acr0nym> Ah, groovy.
1276718503: <]3d0g> Steam coming to the PS3 too
1276718507: <acr0nym> Really?
1276718512: <acr0nym> Now, THAT might get me to play Portal.
1276718513: <]3d0g> yup
1276718533: <acr0nym> Since the PS3 is hooked to, by FAR, the best display in my house.  Heh.
1276718539: <]3d0g> indeed
1276718566: <]3d0g> of course, yours hasn't been on in 2 months
1276718570: <acr0nym> Heh.
1276718574: <acr0nym> Yeah, well.
1276718603: <]3d0g> I ain't played much beside Blu-Ray on mine lately.
1276718622: <acr0nym> You've finished LBP, right?
1276718627: <]3d0g> yup
1276718633: <acr0nym> There you have it .
1276718635: <]3d0g> looking forward to LBP2
1276718660: <acr0nym> Video games just don't hold my attention.....
1276718716: <]3d0g> LBP really clicked with me. 
1276718727: <acr0nym> Me, too.  And, it STILL didn't.
1276720100: <dp> I need to complete some of the games I own for the 360, so I have a reason to get rid of them
1276723305: <acr0nym> Niiiice: http://i.imgur.com/MnVzF.png
1276723383: <dp> lol
1276723473: <milkchan> can't look here.  clients abound
1276723477: <dp> sfw
1276723487: <acr0nym> I'll sum it up:
1276723488: <milkchan> which prolly means something different to mike
1276723491: <acr0nym> 1.  find a large padlock
1276723499: <acr0nym> 2. find the nearest hipster with large tunnel plugs
1276723504: <acr0nym> 3. Lock it onto their ear
1276723508: <acr0nym> 4. Run like fuck
1276723545: <acr0nym> Oh, btw, milkchan, you gonna be in Vegas this year?
1276723972: <milkchan> probably not.  work is on a bit "book them until they scream, quit, or go mental" kick
1276723983: <acr0nym> Ah.  Suck.
1276723991: <milkchan> not this year
1276723998: <milkchan> oh that was sympathy.  got it
1276724001: <milkchan> thanks
1276724004: <acr0nym> Heh.
1276724010: <acr0nym> Yes, sympathy.
1276724028: <milkchan> i don't really get much out of cons anymore
1276724044: <acr0nym> Information, or meeting people?
1276724049: <milkchan> information
1276724052: <milkchan> the meeting people is nice
1276724057: <acr0nym> Yeah, that's the thing....
1276724061: <milkchan> specially this year would be good
1276724070: <acr0nym> For that matter, I AM "Information" this year....  Heh.
1276724076: <acr0nym> Working the Information booth at Defcon.
1276724089: <acr0nym> I'm rarely concerned about talks anymore.
1276724091: <milkchan> need out of tripwire.  it's not the laid back funky portland company anymore
1276724103: <milkchan> so the contacts/people will be good
1276724114: <acr0nym> Right....
1276724128: <acr0nym> Work harder to go.  ;)
1276724143: <milkchan> economy is picking up.  i can get a full time admin position for the same money and work about 15 minutes solid a day
1276724145: <milkchan> kinda like you
1276724151: <acr0nym> Fuck you.
1276724157: <acr0nym> There is NO way I work 15 minutes a day.
1276724163: <milkchan> less?
1276724165: <acr0nym> Heh.
1276724166: <acr0nym> Exaclty.
1276724169: <milkchan> see?
1276724184: <milkchan> i'm ground for nearly every minute of every day most weeks
1276724192: <acr0nym> Yeah, that's gotta suck.
1276724194: <milkchan> plus the travel time, the paper work
1276724201: <acr0nym> You've certainly been quieter, which is a bad sign.
1276724206: <milkchan> if the installs and configs dont well the clients get abusive
1276724215: <milkchan> just burned out
1276724228: <acr0nym> Yeah, also no good.
1276724250: <milkchan> they used to give unallocated bench time.  i swear my home time is worse than my road time because i wind up doing all day remotes.  can't multitask while on a 8 hour webex
1276724303: <TeleCon> ew
1276724310: <TeleCon> 8 hour webex? Yuck.
1276724323: <milkchan> they also used to have whole week training at least once a year back at portland.  now they schedule a webex and don't even block off the time. so anyone that's billing - usually all of us
1276724326: <milkchan> doesn't get any training at all
1276724339: <milkchan> so we're falling hopelessly behind on new product features
1276724345: <milkchan> no lab time
1276724347: <milkchan> no training time
1276724353: <milkchan> no time to catch a breather
1276724386: <milkchan> it's all money grubbing
1276724395: <milkchan> maximal extraction of value out of every employee
1276724412: <acr0nym> Yep.  That's what killed tinfoil and myself so fiercely at Coalfire.
1276724550: <milkchan> i'm totally ready for a mind numbing full time position that's a local commute.  who cares if the job is interesting, i'll at least get to have a life
1276724709: <milkchan> migrating back to the hotel.  it's strange.  i can get from here to there without touching the ground.  there's a "skyway" on the 2nd floor of all the buildings
1276724722: <milkchan> but all the shops in there close between 4 and 6pm
1276724730: <milkchan> the whole city pretty much closes at 6pm
1276724815: <]3d0g> Calgary was the first city I saw that had those skyways. Seemed weird walking through empty office buildings @ night.
1276726331: <acr0nym> OUT.
1276726519: <]3d0g> ditto.
1276726611: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
1276778812: <fbx> oof
1276778820: <fbx> week has flown by
1276781170: <dp> not enough though
1276784314: --> ]3d0g (jkarp@6988929A.F4AE6A51.BF63E968.IP) has joined #lobby
1276784314: <PipSqueek> ]3d0g: Prost!
1276784987: <]3d0g> I may have started an international incident. 
1276785167: <milkchan> awesome
1276785172: <milkchan> did it involve a fart?
1276787207: <]3d0g> No, my new kobo. I had grumbled on FB this morning that my Borders kobo order showed backordered (it still does), and the CEO of Kobo replied to me saying he called the CEO of Borders who was investigating.
1276787221: <]3d0g> It just arrived at my house moments ago. Ooops :)
1276787227: <acr0nym> What's a kobo?
1276787240: <]3d0g> http://www.koboereader.com/
1276787281: <acr0nym> Ah.  What's that cost?
1276787291: <]3d0g> $150.
1276787318: <acr0nym> Nice.  I wish it connected to Amazon/Kindle books....  Heh.
1276787329: <acr0nym> I sure hope they "Open up" access to that stuff, somehow.
1276787332: <]3d0g> Amazon will make sure that never happens.
1276787343: <acr0nym> I dunno....
1276787347: <acr0nym> It'd be an awfully smart move.
1276787358: <acr0nym> Do you think they make more money on Kindle hardware, or e-books?
1276787368: <]3d0g> books, I'm sure
1276787377: <acr0nym> There you have it....
1276787378: <acr0nym> heh.
1276787413: <]3d0g> which is why they've put apps on every device
1276787476: <acr0nym> Yeah, but, I want a cheaper, smaller, e-ink device.
1276787477: <acr0nym> Heh.
1276787504: <]3d0g> we'll have to have lunch to compare soon.
1276787521: <acr0nym> Indeed.
1276787526: <]3d0g> I quite like that the kobo works with public libraries too. 
1276787582: <acr0nym> In what respect?
1276787590: <acr0nym> And, what time should I shoot to arrive at your location today?
1276787800: <]3d0g> most pub libraries now do e-lending via epub. http://downloadmedia.denverlibrary.org/9CAA8F2D-2F54-4DC1-B1A9-78D6A7C2C4A9/10/274/en/Default.htm
1276787834: <]3d0g> wings in the 12-2 range somewhere so before or after
1276787844: <acr0nym> Umm.  That's helpful.  ;)
1276787859: <acr0nym> At least, if I'm going to wings....  ;)
1276787883: <acr0nym> I'll prolly shoot to get there between 11:30 and 11:45, get stuff (you have the stuff, right?  :) ) and join for some wings.
1276787898: <]3d0g> oh you're absolutely welcome to wings! 
1276787921: <acr0nym> I figgered, apparently.  heh.
1276789296: <TeleCon> Is that today?
1276789312: <]3d0g> what?
1276789319: <TeleCon> Wings?
1276789320: <]3d0g> wings?
1276789490: <acr0nym> Heh, wow.  Who's on first?
1276789497: <acr0nym> TeleCon: Yes, today is wings day.
1276789514: <TeleCon> Oh ah
1276789521: <TeleCon> I should have remembered.
1276789530: <acr0nym> Right.  You never could get the hang of Thursdays.
1276789531: <]3d0g> OK, foundries wiped to factory defaults
1276789537: <acr0nym> Nice.
1276789551: <TeleCon> Nope
1276789560: <acr0nym> How 'bout the Tap-a-Draft, which is ACTUALLY what I care about today?
1276789562: <acr0nym> ;)
1276789580: <]3d0g> ready to go in two big garbage bags :)
1276789582: <TeleCon> acr0nym: You going to bsides tomorrow?
1276789585: <acr0nym> TeleCon: yes.
1276789591: <]3d0g> I'll e-mail you the docs shortly
1276789608: <TeleCon> k
1276789611: <TeleCon> ]3d0g: You?
1276789639: <]3d0g> naw
1276789700: <acr0nym> TeleCon: You?
1276789727: <TeleCon> I believe so, but will probably be late.
1276789743: <acr0nym> Groovy.
1276789743: <TeleCon> Trying to work it so I can just stay down here.
1276789754: <acr0nym> Down where?
1276789768: <TeleCon> At bsides.
1276789775: <TeleCon> I'm at the office today.
1276789795: <acr0nym> So, uh, stay down there overnight?  you completely lost me.
1276789810: <TeleCon> No, not have to go get the twins, get them home, and then drive back to Denver.
1276789863: <acr0nym> Ah.
1276790140: <TeleCon> Because that is a lot of driving.
1276790169: <]3d0g> someone really needs to get working on the teleporter.
1276790773: <TeleCon> True
1276795118: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: You said you leave at noon for wings?  Or, do you actually leave earlier?
1276795148: <]3d0g> looks like we're shooting to head out about then
1276795198: <acr0nym> A'ight, I've gotta wait for a process to finish.  Should be leaving here, I hope, right about 11:30.
1276795208: <]3d0g> awesome: http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/06/puzzle_table_bases.html
1276795217: <acr0nym> With any luck, should hit there around 11:45 or so.
1276795221: <]3d0g> perfect
1276795233: <acr0nym> Heh, those are cool.
1276795999: <acr0nym> ]3d0g:  Should be leaving within 6 minutes.  Watch Latitude for where I am....  Heh.

1276873316: <acr0nym> Anyone curious about my day: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bsidesbay
1276873529: <]3d0g> found that stand acr0. I'm an idiot. PM me your addy and I'll just drop it in the mail. 
1276873870: <acr0nym> Heh, it's not a HUGE issue, doesn't seem to sit too badly, propped up by a 12 pack....  Heh.
1276873890: <acr0nym> although, you didn't mention, starting with NON-carbonated liquid, it takes FOUR carts to carbonate.  ;)
1276874561: <]3d0g> for my beer, it usually took 2 to carbonate, and 2 to push the bottle out. So yeah, gotta buy those chargers in bulk :)
1276875999: <acr0nym> Heh.
1276876260: <]3d0g> Real key is to get the liquid as cold as possible first and leave some headspace in the bottle. start with 1 charge, wait 24 hours, 2nd charge, wait 24-48 and it should be ready to drink. Doesn't take a week like the docs claim.
1276877039: <acr0nym> Yep.
1276877045: <acr0nym> Nice and cold, first charge last night.

1276878605: <fbx> so more and more of my high school acquaintances are on FB lately
1276878636: <fbx> man, some of those folks seem to have sat on the couch eating bon bons a LOT since graduation
1276878660: <fbx> and they are overwhelmingly conservative, which is...well, interesting
1276878707: <]3d0g> I ignore all HS requests.
1276878727: <fbx> well, some i wondered about and wanted to re-connect with
1276878730: <acr0nym> Heh, I should have.
1276878738: <fbx> some...not as much
1276878758: <]3d0g> can't say I ever wondered about a single one of them.
1276878796: <fbx> and funniest? the most conservative ones seem to have had a kid within 3-4 years of graduation
1276878826: <fbx> coincidence?
1276878842: <acr0nym> Nah, isn't that the American dream?  Get married, have a kid, buy the home?
1276878866: <fbx> uh...i didn't say they got married or bought a home, i said they HAD A KID. full stop.
1276878891: <fbx> several are divorced, but even some with kids that old aren't married or haven't been before
1276878932: <fbx> many with older kids don't have houses, or barely have their parent's size houses
1276878933: <acr0nym> Heh.
1276878937: <acr0nym> Yeah, I know, I was being sarcastic.
1276878950: <acr0nym> Conservatives don't believe in birth control, or abortion.  ;)
1276879043: <fbx> i know, and i know you were being sarcastic
1276879055: <fbx> but i'm surprised by the number in that boat
1276879077: <fbx> i knew we were the lower to middle middle class, but sheesh
1276879758: <milkchan> heh.  i want to reconnect with my class from catholic school.  every one of the girls in my freshman class was supremely fuckable save for one and she was nice enough to not feel guilty if you got caught all up in her shite
1276879904: <milkchan> public school was full of moo
1276879956: <fbx> did you school in jersey?
1276880093: <milkchan> jaes
1276880119: <milkchan> cute girls in short pleated skirts.  i'm surprised i made it the full year 
1276880129: <milkchan> obviously i was asked not to return
1276880132: <milkchan> after that year
1276880374: <fbx> i've met jersey girls. some (in the south, anyway) are fairly hot - the not hot tend to be a little cow-like. some (esp. up north), not so much, unless you like your poon bridge and tunnel style. 
1276880381: <fbx> at least, that's my limited experienc3e
1276880384: <fbx> -3
1276880601: <fbx> ok, small rant
1276880683: <fbx> if you use the kitchen sink and wash dishes, ring out the fucking washcloth and hang it on the faucet so it dries. that's the fourth one in the last 3 months that now smells like ass because some dipshit doesn't a) know that anyway and b) can't read the fucking sign that says to do so that's right behind the faucet on the wall.

1276888363: <]3d0g> I thought it was the republican party's shining moment.
1276888389: <fbx> it was awesome if you don't like rethugs
1276888391: <fbx> but
1276888548: <fbx> in order for me to side with government as The Entity I Trust Negligibly More over Big Business, they're going to have to do better than excoriate ijits like barton
1276891090: <fbx> anybody use doubletwist?
1276891215: <]3d0g> no, but I learned from Zombieland that you must always doubletap.
1276891385: <acr0nym> True dat.
1276891428: <]3d0g> best talk so far acr0.
1276891508: <acr0nym> Yeah, this one is interesting.
1276891555: <]3d0g> who is this? didn't pay attention @ first

1276891612: <acr0nym> Not that we're really on schedule.
1276891662: <]3d0g> dunno why but that URL hasn't ever worked for me

1277133120: <acr0nym> Yeah, it's insane.
1277133157: <acr0nym> For me, compared to the Honda 600 CC, it's "0-60 in 'what the FUCK just happened?'"

1277133229: <acr0nym> And, uh, happy birthday.  ;)
1277133235: <]3d0g> yeah, umm, whoops.
1277133332: <acr0nym> Good LORD, I hate the Help Desk:

1277133337: <acr0nym> He said it worked on Saturday but not today. 
1277133409: <]3d0g> tell him due to school budget cuts, e-mail is no longer delivered on mondays.
1277133436: <dp> fbx: unfortunately, I don't know what the normal bill is :(
1277133487: <dp> or tell him about the 600 mile limit ;)
1277133505: <acr0nym> I'm just wondering what the hell we're supposed to do about it?
1277133512: <acr0nym> And, realistically, why the ticket came to me?
1277133513: <acr0nym> Heh.
1277133627: <dp> fbx: I lied.  just found out the normal bill is $1200/mo
1277133640: <acr0nym> So, this one is 2700?
1277133643: <dp> yep
1277133665: <acr0nym> Nice.
1277133775: <acr0nym> I am SERIOUSLY fucking sick of iTunes deciding it should stop updating podcasts.
1277134189: <]3d0g> what is this iTunes of which you speak? :)
1277134202: <]3d0g> why ain't you doing 'casts on the Nexus anyway?
1277134216: <acr0nym> Because I have no good way to listen to them....
1277134226: <acr0nym> From the Nexus.
1277134260: <]3d0g> where do you listen?
1277134279: <acr0nym> Mostly from the Mac that has the iTunes.
1277134280: <acr0nym> Heh.
1277134280: <acr0nym> At work.
1277134284: <]3d0g> ah
1277134303: <acr0nym> I do, sincerely, wish that my car stereo had an Aux input.
1277134316: <acr0nym> Every FM transmitter I've tried with it has SUCKED.
1277134322: <]3d0g> yeah, they really do
1277134337: <]3d0g> just get a new stereo
1277134345: <]3d0g> hell, most come with bluetooth now
1277134356: <acr0nym> I may look into it.
1277134403: <acr0nym> I'd need to find out how well stuff can integrate with my car.  Allegedly, Hyundai is in the class of manufacturers who make the car stereo practically part of the computer system that operates the car.
1277134421: <dp> hrm.  anyone know where I can get a list of error codes for rm?
1277134429: <acr0nym> Awesome.  Once again, one of the retards who THINKS they have "myoder@gmail.com" is trying to reset my password.
1277134444: <acr0nym> I'm betting it's the bitch in Arizona getting extermination services.

1277155231: <tinfoil> I got to see Splice over the weekend
1277155290: <tinfoil> It's a seriously fucked up movie with a bad plot.  The funny part is - great cinematography, directing, acting, and writing in spite of a bad plot
1277155295: <tinfoil> Really enjoyed it
1277155332: <tinfoil> It won an aware for best effects at Sundance, but the effects don't make the movie
1277155349: <acr0nym> Have you seen Human Centipede?
1277155366: <tinfoil> No
1277155401: <acr0nym> It's supposed to be almost the epitome of bad cult film.
1277155538: <tinfoil> Wow, read about it on wikipedia

1277155550: <acr0nym> Heh.
1277155552: <acr0nym> Yep.

1277236414: <tinfoil> which is surprisingly accurate considering how inaccurate it's normally

1277238003: <acr0nym> 3 carts in, so far, separated by 24 hours each.

1277238012: <tinfoil> Open Cola?
1277238015: <]3d0g> ouch

1277238038: <acr0nym> Heh.
1277238073: <]3d0g> I carbonated ciders with good success. Wouldn't think they'd be that much different
1277238160: <tinfoil> yeast and sugar didn't help?
1277238173: <acr0nym> I'm not making my own carbonated water...
1277238188: <acr0nym> Mixed Opencola syrup with regular water, trying to carbonate all of that.
1277238189: <acr0nym> Heh.
1277238302: <tinfoil> Out of curiosity, does it taste like flat cola?
1277238324: <acr0nym> Heh, it does.
1277238335: <tinfoil> neat :-)
1277238439: <acr0nym> Actually, I've made some just mixing syrup with Seltzer Water, which tastes good.
1277238548: <]3d0g> Wonder if going that route and then using the TaD to maintain CO2 and serve might not be a bad idea
1277238577: <acr0nym> Mebbe.
1277238590: <acr0nym> Or, just get a seltzer bottle, and go super retro.  Heh.
1277238609: <dp> TaD?

1277238628: <dp> ah
1277238739: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: Where'd you get a 24-pack of bestwhip carts?  All I see is a 10-pack.
1277238854: <]3d0g> I think they discontinued the 24pack
1277238857: <acr0nym> Ah.
1277238859: <acr0nym> Gotcha.
1277238860: <tinfoil> Used to getting NO2 and not CO2
1277238881: <acr0nym> Heh, it's N2O.
1277238909: <]3d0g> discount code 'Best Whip 4 July' will get 10% off
1277238927: <tinfoil> Typo :-)
1277238969: <acr0nym> And, was that a question, or a comment from your world?
1277238970: <acr0nym> Heh.
1277239163: <tinfoil> Oh, caffeine is option, nice! (evil stuff), coloring is optional (nice bonus!), and even better you can adjust the sugar ammount (since it's too sweet)
1277239216: <]3d0g> Sodas should be around 3 volumes of CO2, right?
1277239238: <acr0nym> According to their documents, actually 4.
1277239244: <acr0nym> But, they also want a week to absorb the first two.
1277239245: <acr0nym> Heh.
1277239293: <]3d0g> TaD regulators are fixed at 15 psi, so at 35 deg, 3 volumes is about the max.
1277239317: <acr0nym> I'm just tellin' ya what the documentation says.
1277239340: <]3d0g> who's?
1277239354: <acr0nym> Tap-A-Draft
1277239456: <acr0nym> Oh, so, effectively, force carbonation is two cartridges, plus one week to absorb.  Then, two more cartridges to dispense.
1277239483: <]3d0g> Smoking crack, they are. For the TaD to achieve 4 volumes with the fixed 15 psi, the liquid would need to be 23 degrees.
1277239516: <acr0nym> You are now ready to force carbonate with 2 CO2 cartridges. Follow the procedure for dispensing the cartridges as per previous instructions.. Remember the PET bottle must be HORIZONTAL to charge with CO2.
1277239520: <acr0nym> After charging the 2 x 8grams CO2 cartridges, the beer will need to remain refrigerated for approx. a week to mature and for the CO2 to be absorbed into the beer.
1277239524: <acr0nym> TO SERVE THE BEER FROM TAP-A-DRAFT
1277239526: <acr0nym> When you are ready to serve the beer you will need to prime the beer with another 2 x 8gram CO2 cartridges in the same manner to provide DISPENSNG PRESSURE.
1277239671: <]3d0g> Oooh, here's a good point. fermented liquids have one volume CO2 "built in". 
1277239678: <]3d0g> Sodas don't.
1277239688: <acr0nym> Ah.
1277240191: <]3d0g> Was curious if brix had an impact on CO2 absorption. Nothing I found said it did. Just pressure and temp.
1277240293: <acr0nym> brix?
1277240361: <]3d0g> measure of sugar
1277240366: <acr0nym> Oh, right, right.
1277240606: <]3d0g> most of my beers finish around 1-4 brix tops. Soda is what, 15ish?
1277241607: <acr0nym> Beats me.
1277242491: <]3d0g> how much sugar in what volume of water?
1277242516: <acr0nym> Heh, dude, the recipe's on that Wikipedia page.  You're Mr. Math today....
1277242547: <acr0nym> 2.36 kg sugr/2.28L water.
1277242623: <]3d0g> that's the syrup what's it diluted to?
1277242656: <TeleCon> BOOZE!
1277242661: <acr0nym> Yes.
1277242664: <acr0nym> Oh, 5:!.
1277242666: <acr0nym> 5:1, even.
1277242711: <]3d0g> 17.8 brix.
1277242728: <acr0nym> There you have it.  The answer to your question is "18ish".
1277242728: <acr0nym> Heh.

1277391566: <acr0nym> Wow, just a stunning amount of retardation at large in the world today.
1277392122: <dp> here as well
1277392133: <]3d0g> here too
1277392332: <acr0nym> Joy.  It's a pandemic.
1277392341: <]3d0g> "Phone doesn't answer in conference room." It's integrated into the video conferencing system. Did you touch the panel to turn it on? "No." How were you planning on answering it then?
1277392348: <TeleCon> Great.  I haven't left the house yet and now I don't want to.
1277392713: <acr0nym> Yeah, you prolly shouldn't.
1277392776: <dp> I'm getting backlash from a user that I pinpointed as the possible source of a bandwidth overage
1277392916: <]3d0g> When people do bad things to the network here, I just kill their ports.
1277393194: <]3d0g> Gotta have the audio on to appreciate this ICHCB: http://icanhascheezburger.com/2010/06/24/funny-pictures-kitteh-watches-world-cup/
1277393471: <acr0nym> Man, I have a bad feeling that SOMEONE is gonna get a sharp fountain pen in the eye today.
1277393479: <acr0nym> And, worse, it may be me.
1277393503: <acr0nym> Do I get Workman's Comp if my retarded cow-orkers make me mad enough to try to stab my brain?
1277393633: <]3d0g> I believe so
1277393718: <acr0nym> SWEET.  Commencing Operation "Pointy Stick Brain Massage" now!
1277393870: <]3d0g> OHHH yes. The dumb is thick today.
1277393952: <]3d0g> "I can't get to your wiki." It's on the RCN (corp backbone). Is your office not connected? "Oh, I can get to the wiki fine from the office but not VPN." Umm, did you mention this to your VPN support team?
1277394090: <]3d0g> Oh, and phone girl *still* doesn't get that the system must be turned on for it to receive a call...
1277394286: <acr0nym> Huh?
1277394300: <acr0nym> Haven't heard that complaint from you....
1277394356: <]3d0g> ?
1277394453: <acr0nym> About "phone girl".
1277394467: <acr0nym> So, the "still" makes less sense.  Prolly been whining in #dv.  ;)
1277394537: <]3d0g> you must've missed my earlier post. this was an update to the stupidity.
1277394545: <acr0nym> Ah, mebbe.
1277394562: <acr0nym> Ah, yeah, I missed it.
1277394562: <acr0nym> Heh.
1277394571: <acr0nym> Niiiice.

1277397631: <acr0nym> Yeah, but, at least he's our wingnut.
1277397780: <]3d0g> I want a safety vest.
1277397795: <acr0nym> I'm surprised you don't have one.
1277397795: <dp> How bad do you have to screw up being the co-founder to not get the newest products without having to stand in line?!? Does anyone know what he did to piss Jobs off?
1277397798: <dp> lol
1277397817: <]3d0g> not that at all
1277397830: <]3d0g> he absolutely could. He *chooses* to do this

1277397884: <dp> sfw
1277398004: <]3d0g> man I love this. we're a couple million $ into a test implementation with Microsoft. Just got off a call where they mention they can only ingest IGMPv2. We're SSM IGMPv3. bummer.
1277398060: <]3d0g> I could literally here the MSFT engineers shitting themselves over the phone.
1277398070: <acr0nym> Nice!
1277398079: <acr0nym> What's the implementation of?
1277398103: <dp> ingest?
1277398104: <]3d0g> welllll, I can't really say. 
1277398115: <acr0nym> Heh, ah.
1277398128: <]3d0g> cable company + igmp should give a clue
1277398163: <acr0nym> Yeah, if I felt like thinking that much.
1277398170: <acr0nym> I sense some hint of a clue somewhere in my brain.
1277398203: <]3d0g> it'll all end in tears. all my team's CYA is documented. that's all I care about.
1277398227: <acr0nym> WTH are you involved at all?  That sounds pretty firmly like Alan's job.
1277398248: <]3d0g> Alan? Microsoft? HAHAHAHAHA!
1277398258: <acr0nym> I meant more "cable company".
1277398295: <]3d0g> it's a hell of a lot less "cable" and more data these days. hence the multicast.
1277398302: <acr0nym> Fair enough.
1277398706: <acr0nym> Seriously, though, I wanna know WTH I got outta bed today.
1277399031: <TeleCon> good question
1277399109: <]3d0g> because the cat needed noms.
1277399129: <acr0nym> Oh, yeah, I suppose so.  Coulda gone BACK to bed after that.  Heh.
1277399814: <TeleCon> I'm considering going back to bed.
1277399865: <acr0nym> Yeah, what are they gonna do, fire you?
1277399866: <acr0nym> ;)
1277399880: <TeleCon> Exactly.
1277400116: <TeleCon> acr0nym: Does your in dash mp3 player have a limit on the number of files in a directory?
1277400135: <acr0nym> Not that I've noticed, but, I break things up pretty significantly, usually.
1277400297: <]3d0g> dunno the accuracy of this story, but methinks the cop should've been shot for home invasion. http://gizmodo.com/5571246/man-arrested-for-photographing-cop-who-followed-him-into-his-home
1277400298: <TeleCon> Mine has a 255 file per directory limit on it.
1277400330: <TeleCon> ]3d0g: Yeah, then the photographer would be facing capital murder charges.
1277400333: <TeleCon> Fuck the system.
1277400348: <]3d0g> not in CO. Make my Day.
1277400354: <acr0nym> Thank you, Ice-T.
1277400379: <TeleCon> Even in Colorado, I'm guessing.  The DA/Police protect their own.
1277400386: <]3d0g> true
1277400387: <TeleCon> That's one of my nightmares
1277400414: <TeleCon> Shooting a cop in my house thinking it is a home invasion.
1277400415: <]3d0g> this no filming cops shit needs to come to a head pronto.
1277400421: <TeleCon> Concur
1277400832: <fbx> why can't you film cops?
1277400948: <acr0nym> Ostensibly, you should be able to.....  That's the point.  Also, fuck Concur.  Those guys were jerks.
1277401885: <TeleCon> Well, yeah.  It's a strong hazard of being a cop.

1277746879: <acr0nym> Heh, nice.
1277746893: <tinfoil> The worst part?  It received a score of 8 post earthquake in 2002
1277746905: <tinfoil> So they knew it was that bad for 8 years
1277746917: <acr0nym> Heh, awesome.
1277746940: <tinfoil> Do even get me started on the Alaskan viaduct
1277746954: <tinfoil> or the 45th St Viaduct, or 520 bridge
1277746974: <tinfoil> most of which are like 10+ years past their expected life
1277747161: <dp> everything is past it's expected life, because no one wants to pay for it
1277748061: <tinfoil> Yep
1277748088: <tinfoil> the 520 bridge isn't a huge deal (yet), but the viaducts are
1277748117: <tinfoil> they were all damaged in the last major earthquake, and were designed well before modern earthquake technology came about
1277748139: <tinfoil> so it's pretty much assumed that they will all collapse if we get anything moderate
1277748148: <tinfoil> (seriously)
1277748186: <tinfoil> I'll see if I can take pictures of the alaskan viaduct's metal supports that were post in after 2002
1277748684: <tinfoil> dp:  What's the alternative to BlueprintCSS?  Which do you prefer?
1277748880: <tinfoil> I should be clear, I found some alternatives via google
1277748883: <tinfoil> what do you prefer
1277748887: <tinfoil> and why
1277750175: <milkchan> at least one of the conservative justices needs to have an "accident"
1277750327: <milkchan> i did the tripwire installation at PCAOB
1277750437: <milkchan> huh the deciscion looks like it just opens up board members to politically motivated firings.

1277750479: <]3d0g> yeah, it didn't live up to the hype of the initial tweets.

1277997901: <milkchan> the only kobo buzz i've heard so far is from this obscure little chat room
1277997913: <]3d0g> absolutely. kobobooks came out device agnostic and all the rest scrambled to match
1277997914: <milkchan> i think the guy owns stock but i dunno
1277997933: <tinfoil> Amazon is going the way of NeXT with their software kindle
1277997994: <]3d0g> so is B&N, and both are following kobo. The hardware essentially becomes irrelevant.

1277998022: <]3d0g> but eReaders will be the big holiday item this year.
1277998029: <tinfoil> but Nook has been reviewed as more buggy
1277998037: <tinfoil> (that being said Kindle is much older)
1277998049: <tinfoil> I still like the ePaper over LCD
1277998050: <]3d0g> old tinfoil. nook patched a LOOONG time ago.
1277998095: <]3d0g> and # of titles is all marketing. Some lump Gutenberg into their counts.
1277998113: <tinfoil> ePaper, from my experience is much easier to read in more environments
1277998116: <tinfoil> http://www.digitaltrends.com/gadgets/kindle-vs-nook-an-e-reader-face-off/2/
1277998119: <tinfoil> Feb 09 2010
1277998124: <tinfoil> Said it's buggy :-)
1277998127: * tinfoil ducks
1277998138: <]3d0g> never heard of the site. 
1277998140: <tinfoil> Haven't tried it yes
1277998143: <tinfoil> yet
1277998225: <]3d0g> there will be several sub $100 eReader choices by christmas.
1277998233: <tinfoil> Yeah
1277998241: <tinfoil> I agree with your prediction :-)
1277998334: <]3d0g> I'm still quite happy with the kobo, even though everyone's price matching now. I like the open hardware. Use whatever software you want - or none. It's just a USB drive.
1277998394: <]3d0g> Plus it's still the smallest and lightest of all of 'em with a 6" e-ink.
1277998648: <acr0nym> The kobo is?
1277998660: <]3d0g> yeah
1277998791: <acr0nym> Meh.  Although I'm semi-locked into Amazon, at this point, I still don't feel too bad that I'm likely going to buy a Kindle 2 to go with the DX.....  As far as I can tell, it can read almost as many formats as anything else, and conversion is startlingly painless.
1277998905: <]3d0g> Indeed. If I were buying today and saw that woot this morning, I wouldn't have thought twice before hitting BUY
1277998916: <acr0nym> Yeah, I wish I hadn't stalled.
1277998985: <]3d0g> At this point, e-ink is solid tech and while there's minor differences, any hardcore reader will be happy with any of them.
1277999006: <acr0nym> Yeah, I continue to love the DX.
1277999013: <acr0nym> I just want the smaller one for travel/transportability.
1277999556: <milkchan> holy crap.  one of my colleges is actually retiring
1277999563: <milkchan> to sail the world no less
1277999581: <acr0nym> How does a whole college sail the world?  Huge barge?
1277999645: <milkchan> i was counting on some mike level of auto translate
1277999652: <acr0nym> NO!
1277999658: <tinfoil> Did you see the philadelphia experiment
1277999664: <tinfoil> ?
1277999669: <tinfoil> That's hwo
1277999671: <tinfoil> how
1277999671: <milkchan> mmmm sailors
1277999675: <acr0nym> Heh, that still wasn't the WHOLE college.
1277999693: <tinfoil> No, a whole town was pulled into the vortex
1277999696: <milkchan> now if they could figure out how to take only the hot ones and leave acro with the rest
1277999712: * milkchan cues up clutch
1277999719: <tinfoil> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Experiment_(film)
1277999726: <acr0nym> milkchan: I'd be alone.  which would be fine.
1277999734: <tinfoil> Someone stole my $15 headphones in the office, so no music for mikie
1277999800: <milkchan> damn.  they're ~all~ cute at CU?
1277999987: <acr0nym> Pretty damn close.  It's nuts.
1278000470: <milkchan> that's proof of age right there
1278000474: <milkchan> advanced age at that
1278000641: <milkchan> oh shit they changed the product logo again.  we're going to need new business cards... again
1278000651: <tinfoil> Hah
1278000658: <acr0nym> Which is proof of whose age?
1278000659: <tinfoil> That reminds me, I need business cards
1278000690: <milkchan> make business cards that say only "intentionally blank"
1278000693: <tinfoil> milkchan: Speaking age and perception of attractiveness - remember Kaplan?
1278000693: <milkchan> and hand them out
1278000706: <milkchan> that wasn't age, that was bad weed
1278000721: <tinfoil> Hah
1278000730: <tinfoil> And years of marriage (possibly sexless)
1278000755: <milkchan> speaking of old, his kids are prolly all grown by now
1278000880: <tinfoil> Damn, invited 60+ people to a party, and >50% attending, 30% maybe, 20% not attending, and 10% no response
1278000904: <milkchan> did a tweet constitute an invite?
1278000911: <milkchan> i didn't respond
1278000912: <tinfoil> No
1278000924: <milkchan> ah then i didn't get invited!
1278000926: <tinfoil> I asked people give me their addresses
1278000929: * milkchan mutters, "bastard"
1278000943: <tinfoil> If someone didn't send their address, I didn't invite them
1278000962: <tinfoil> Ok, I sent it to all the locals I know too
1278000976: <milkchan> meaning nobody across the lake?
1278000983: <milkchan> cos they're eviiiiil?
1278000989: <tinfoil> 3 people across the late
1278000990: <tinfoil> lake
1278000994: <tinfoil> :-p
1278001255: <tinfoil> I think what amazes me is that I'm throwing my first ever party and that more people are attending than I even knew after living in CO for 8 years
1278001282: <tinfoil> acr0nym: You can change the topic, by the way.  :-)
1278001341: --- acr0nym has changed the topic to: "Everyone rises to their level of incompetence." -- Laurence J. Peter
1278001368: * tinfoil Strives towards mediocrity and fails.
1278001431: <milkchan> is anyone single in CO?  above the age of 21 i mean?
1278001446: <acr0nym> Yeah.
1278001451: <acr0nym> Like, ME, ass.
1278001461: <milkchan> retread?
1278001464: <acr0nym> Thank you for bringing up THAT painful memory....
1278001466: <acr0nym> Heh.
1278001501: <acr0nym> I'm not sure what you mean by "retread", unless you misspelled 'tard.
1278001535: <milkchan> retread.  euphemism for divorced peoples in bars
1278001550: <acr0nym> Ah.  No, in Colorado, that word now seems to be "poly".
1278001553: <milkchan> they have whole retread scenes here
1278001573: <milkchan> are there polyvirgins?
1278001629: <milkchan> that's cool though.  good to see mormanism colliding with the fascist christians you got creeping out of colorado springs
1278001638: <acr0nym> Heh.
1278001640: <tinfoil> poly is the word in almost all major cities
1278001648: <acr0nym> I meant "polyamorous", not polygamy.
1278001657: <acr0nym> And, yeah, I suspect that's true.
1278001706: <milkchan> i think i'm going out for the first time in like... 4 years
1278001723: <acr0nym> Hey, speaking of out, tinfoil/milkchan, either of you gonna be at Defcon?
1278001725: <milkchan> that's because another one of my retread friends is back in a band
1278001768: <milkchan> lovely how these people got married, fell off the face of the earth for a decade, and now want to party and get pissed off at me for not dropping everything to hang out with them cos i'm single
1278001772: <milkchan> and they're suddenly single
1278001777: <milkchan> therefore i need to party too...
1278001782: <acr0nym> Yep.
1278001802: <acr0nym> That's exactly how I'm treating all of my single friends.
1278001812: <acr0nym> Nah.  I like to drink alone.
1278001814: <acr0nym> Heh.
1278001820: <]3d0g> http://nedroid.com/2009/05/party-cat-full-series/
1278001848: <milkchan> "duuuude!  you used to be the most unemployed out of ALL of us! what the fuck happened?"  "uh, you got married and stopped talking to me prolly cuz your wife was a cunt and hated me?"
1278001913: <tinfoil> I've noticed that the more my friends like who I'm dating the longer they tend to last
1278001927: <acr0nym> ANSWER THE DEFCON QUESTION.
1278001936: <tinfoil> Not likely, I can't afford it 
1278001938: <tinfoil> paying double rent
1278001942: <acr0nym> Harsh.
1278001958: <tinfoil> Didn't expect to find such an awesome place, let along move
1278001959: <milkchan> no defcon for me.  cute boy i met at the last one i went to isnt going so very little incentive
1278001997: <acr0nym> No, it's cool, DJ sailorgloom'll be there....
1278002002: <]3d0g> ewww
1278002064: <acr0nym> I can't believe it's "retarded help desk ticket day" again already.  I thought these two days would be QUIET.
1278002083: <milkchan> mike knows that's just revenge for us getting more goth chix than sailorgloom ever did in the ny scene
1278002090: <acr0nym> Heh.
1278002104: <acr0nym> Apparently, Delchi still likes 'im.
1278002119: <milkchan> i wanna fuck his ex wife
1278002140: <milkchan> she was one of the few women that got hotter as she aged
1278002146: <milkchan> haven't seen her in a while though
1278002150: <acr0nym> Delchi has an ex wife?
1278002157: <milkchan> noo sailorgloom
1278002161: <acr0nym> Heh, yeah, I know.
1278002177: <milkchan> i don't know what a delchi is.  is that something to do with frame relay?
1278002214: <acr0nym> If you know sailorgloom and the NYC goth scene, I'd be willing to be you know delchi.
1278002219: <tinfoil> Delchi is a DJ and hangs out in the DefCon crowd, especially 303.  He used to spin for Click-n-Drag in NYC
1278002227: <acr0nym> http://www.newgothcity.com/djprofiledelchi.html
1278002242: <tinfoil> acr0nym: No, milkchan wasn't involved much with the side of the scene where Delchi was
1278002245: <milkchan> ah i never made it to a click n drag.  pyramid and bank
1278002247: <acr0nym> Ah.
1278002261: <acr0nym> Well, that page sez he dj'd both of those places as well.
1278002263: <tinfoil> NYC goth scene had 3 splinters when we were active in it
1278002357: <acr0nym> Now, THIS stuff sounds interesting: http://sugru.com/about/
1278002358: <tinfoil> Old Goths (newwave/punk origins), Vamp-Industrial Goths, and Spookie Kids
1278002384: <milkchan> i finally watched part of party monster
1278002396: <tinfoil> Delchi mostly would spin for Vamp-Industrial crowd
1278002422: <milkchan> who was i hanging out with?  i don't even know
1278002476: <tinfoil> You were hanging out with the more punk/newwave crowd
1278002483: <-- TeleCon has quit (Ping timeout)
1278002510: --> TeleCon (telecon@dp-7FAE314D.net) has joined #lobby
1278002515: <milkchan> wow.  over the hill even back then
1278002520: <tinfoil> I hung out a little with the Vamp crowd too
1278002523: * milkchan runs away and cries pitifully in the bathroom
1278002540: <tinfoil> Nobody liked the spookie kids
1278002544: <tinfoil> I think that's universal
1278002564: * ]3d0g was all nerd & phreaker. No such thing as goths back then.
1278002602: <]3d0g> Some punk, but their drugs sucked.
1278002612: <acr0nym> What does DJ'ing a roll-a-rena qualify as?
1278002613: <tinfoil> ]3d0g: The time I'm talking about was during my professional career.  :-)
1278002628: <]3d0g> professional WHAT? :)
1278002644: <milkchan> crissakes. sony was a professional position?
1278002646: <]3d0g> A job acr0 :) I was in college then.
1278002649: <tinfoil> Shit, I never even tried drugs until I was 35... Kinda happy too.. found out I don't need them to be this weird
1278002669: <]3d0g> man, I was a walking pharmacy in HS.
1278002748: <tinfoil> surprisingly I get less paranoid on drugs
1278002761: <tinfoil> well, not pot, but didn't enjoy pot at all
1278002794: <milkchan> the fucking fbi questioned all of my druggie friends.  they were quite impressed that none of them could remember a time i actually did more than drink even under crossreferenced/cross questioning
1278002804: <milkchan> when they were doing my clearance
1278002809: <acr0nym> cannabinoid dysphoria.
1278002900: <tinfoil> They went to question my friends and were impressed that I didn't have any
1278002918: <acr0nym> Friends?
1278002977: <milkchan> i warned all my friends not to try to lie cos they were too stupid to do it properly
1278003049: <tinfoil> When I ask for references I like asking for honesty - It's better when someone portrays you with flaws in addition to your strong points
1278003055: <tinfoil> makes it sound less made up
1278003078: <milkchan> "mike sucks, but that's one of his more redeeming qualities"
1278003150: <tinfoil> My co workers here use me as the group asshole
1278003333: <milkchan> haha.  does the dog jump ya too?  i thought the black lab there was a girl doggie
1278003439: <tinfoil> that dog is the happiest being in the office
1278003447: <acr0nym> Fuck.  How do I explain what the hell a VPN does to a 60-year-old ContEd student?
1278003461: <acr0nym> Who still calls herself "susie"?
1278003462: <acr0nym> Heh.
1278003517: <milkchan> is she cute?
1278003534: <acr0nym> Haven't seen her, and it seems unlikely.  Continuing Ed doesn't count in my previous claims.
1278003565: <milkchan> oooo fists didn't go up so quickly this time ::: jello voice :::
1278003595: <acr0nym> Heh.
1278003698: <]3d0g> what do students have VPN for anyway?
1278003703: <milkchan> it's pretty easy to explain, though.  ::: niel from the young ones voice ::: imagine... the internet is a series of tuuuubes, man... a vpn is just a tube inside those tubes.  your stuff goes through the private tube and the mean lentil throwing people can't get in
1278003714: <acr0nym> Mostly a Juniper SSL-based VPN now.
1278003723: <acr0nym> And, and old Cisco 3000, which is being phased out.
1278003726: <]3d0g> ugh. Juniper. 
1278003729: <]3d0g> what's it for?
1278003734: <milkchan> flavoring gin
1278003738: <acr0nym> Uh...
1278003741: <tinfoil> Idealy
1278003745: <acr0nym> The same thing a VPN is always for....
1278003753: <acr0nym> Making your traffic appear to be coming from somewhere else.
1278003753: <acr0nym> ;)
1278003754: <]3d0g> no, I mean what do STUDENTS need it for?
1278003763: <tinfoil> acr0nym: job security for networking people?
1278003764: <acr0nym> Library resources, mostly.
1278003778: <acr0nym> Lots of off-campus libraries authenticate based on source IP, basically.
1278003788: <tinfoil> Out of every VPN I ever had to run/support OpenVPN is still the easiest and most stable
1278003796: <acr0nym> I like Hamachi.
1278003796: <acr0nym> Heh.,
1278003797: <]3d0g> guess I've been out of school a while. Don't see the point of tunneling effectively public traffic.
1278003831: <acr0nym> Yeah, eventually it'll be mostly replaced by ID Federation through "inCommon"
1278003864: <acr0nym> Wow, it's just amazing with the Internet how quickly 2500 bucks can evaporate to bills.
1278003881: <acr0nym> Oh, speaking of money, ]3d0g, I have to go pay $.34 to get your mail...  Get a scale!
1278003884: <acr0nym> Heh.
1278003896: <]3d0g> WTF?
1278003903: <]3d0g> fucking post office
1278003904: <acr0nym> 34 cents postage due.
1278003907: <acr0nym> Oh, seriously?
1278003908: <acr0nym> Heh.
1278003910: <acr0nym> Harsh.
1278003929: <]3d0g> THEY'RE the ones who weighed it.
1278003937: <]3d0g> I already had the stamps
1278003938: <tinfoil> Who uses snail mail these days?
1278003939: <]3d0g> assholes
1278003948: <tinfoil> Fucking old-school-analog people
1278003960: <]3d0g> because fucking transporters haven't been invented yet, ass.
1278003992: <tinfoil> You guys work, what, 10 miles from each other?   And acr0nym lives about 5 miles from your office?
1278003993: <milkchan> hey penboy?  i always meant to ask how your penmanship was
1278004108: <tinfoil> Oh yeah, Tracy loved acr0nym's pens
1278004112: <dp> tinfoil: did you see the topic earlier?
1278004121: <tinfoil> dp:  Yeah, I said it could be changed
1278004126: <]3d0g> http://www.leftycartoons.com/the-24-types-of-libertarian/
1278004135: <tinfoil> dp:  get my email?  :-)
1278004149: <dp> to where?
1278004156: <tinfoil> dp@dp.cx
1278004161: <dp> lemme look
1278004188: <dp> I see.  lemme read
1278004206: <tinfoil> It was a hack, but for some reason figured dp would appreciate
1278004219: <tinfoil> and cringe at the same time
1278004252: <dp> interesting concept
1278004274: <tinfoil> It was quick and dirty
1278004276: <tinfoil> and it works
1278004285: <tinfoil> quite well, I might add
1278004290: <tinfoil> better than I expected :-)
1278004295: <acr0nym> milkchan: It's not too bad.  Not calligrapher quality, or anything.
1278004309: <acr0nym> Hell, find out for yourself: http://www.acr0nym.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ACR0NYMPostDefcon.pdf
1278004316: <acr0nym> That's my thoughts on Defcon from last year....
1278004367: <acr0nym> And it's handwritten.
1278004387: <tinfoil> milkchan: His hand writing is better than my typing
1278004472: <milkchan> that's not saying much
1278004564: <acr0nym> Seriously.
1278004598: <milkchan> acroread ACR0NYMPostDefcon.pdf
1278004605: <milkchan> not every day you get to acroread acronym
1278004631: <tinfoil> Wow, you use acroread?
1278004650: <acr0nym> Huh?
1278004657: <tinfoil> Gnome's Document Reader is impressivly good
1278004663: <milkchan> evince?
1278004663: <acr0nym> Oh, ah.
1278004665: <tinfoil> light weight and fast, unlike acroread
1278004674: <tinfoil> the one that comes with ubuntu
1278004688: <tinfoil> It was so good I don't replace it :-)
1278004707: <milkchan> i was very upset you used the standard desktop
1278004717: <tinfoil> I got lazy
1278004749: <tinfoil> I'd rather spend time getting laid, taking cool pictures, and doing fun things rather than support my own desktop
1278004750: <milkchan> it was like seeing your childhood hero's belly flopping over his utility belt, belching a cloud of jack daniels and bemoaning his recent unemployment
1278004803: <]3d0g> ah, nice, so you have met tinfoil IRL :)
1278004846: * milkchan squeals like a girl and hides under a desk in fear of retaliation
1278004875: <tinfoil> ]3d0g: milkchan go back a few years (like 20?)
1278004899: <milkchan> 21 i think
1278004901: <dp> I despise the fact that pdf wants to be opened via gimp on my machine
1278004902: <tinfoil> The only people here I haven't met are dp and fbx-vacation 
1278004904: <dp> how the hell do I change it?
1278004914: <milkchan> if the first time i met you i almost ran you over with a pickup truck by driving it over a basketball court
1278004949: <tinfoil> That's accurate
1278004956: <tinfoil> I was talking to "Rad Eyes"
1278004968: <tinfoil> which was probably her only good physical quality IMHO
1278005036: <dp> nm, I found it
1278005070: <acr0nym> milkchan: So, what do you think?  How's that for penmanship?
1278005107: <milkchan> it's readable and not embarassing
1278005118: <acr0nym> Heh, yeah, that's about what I'm typically going for.
1278005119: <milkchan> i thought you would have written like a 1700's patriot
1278005132: <acr0nym> As far as I can tell, that's a LOT of work.  Heh.

1278011329: <acr0nym> I'm not gonna lie.  I would be, too.
1278011345: <TeleCon> Yeah, they probably hurt less than you though.

1278017816: <ouiji> err
1278018389: <ouiji> dp, I have notes for all of the steps except the one that is the biggest pain in the arse. Netflix calls ActiveX, and you have to fool it into thinking that it is the real activeX when it makes this call:
1278018390: <ouiji> ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP"):new
1278018436: <ouiji> which doesn't seem to be a vital component, since I was able get it playing without any real activex support
1278018466: <ouiji> only problem is, I stumbled onto it late last night, and didn't make notes, so I have to try and figure out how I managed it
1278018752: <ouiji> and if you load the player directly, it will load into Moonlight just fine, but will not load the content
1278018770: <ouiji> example: http://www.netflix.com/pages/watchNow/player/silverlight/SLPlayer.xap?v=384497
1278019415: <ouiji> grrr, and I thought overriding the DRM was going to be the difficult part

1278092634: <]3d0g> I got a Nokia BH-214 that works well.
1278092669: <dp> what I'm after is having a bluetooth headset + mic, so that I can listen to music via bluetooth (from the PC) and answer cell calls (via bluetooth)
1278092743: <tinfoil> Most steteo headsets can bind to multiple devices now
1278092747: <tinfoil> IIRC
1278092776: <tinfoil> Also, dp, you might want to look for ones where there are receivers with microphones in it, but you can plugin your own headphones

1278610713: <tinfoil> system-config-securitylevel
1278610721: <tinfoil> someone edited /etc/sysconfig/iptables
1278610747: <]3d0g> many things can only be done via direct edit (like nat)
1278610757: <tinfoil> They didn't do nat
1278610771: <tinfoil> all they did was allow a few ports by copying and pasting a the ssh line and editing the ports
1278610774: <tinfoil> but nobody knew that
1278610779: <tinfoil> it wasn't documented
1278610799: <tinfoil> and the only servers iptables is enabled on are PCI database servers
1278610827: <tinfoil> so when someone ran system-config-securitylevel it overwrote the changes
1278610901: <tinfoil> We just let go of the company who built those machines
1278610915: <tinfoil> we also aquired the lab they built for us, which is in shambles
1278610993: <tinfoil> 1100 virtual machines, no central authentication, no centralized configuration management, no centralized patch management, and the best part?  Every machine, windows included, has a host based firewall

1278612953: <tinfoil> Someone I know wrote that
1278612997: <tinfoil> Even if you don't have that machine machines, you should always think centralized early - it allows you to add more servers later and still be able to manage things
1278613168: <dp> we don't centralize on anything
1278613204: <dp> is there any kind of web admin/reporting for cfengine?
1278613615: <tinfoil> Dunno, I'm just getting into it
1278613681: <tinfoil> We're going to have an interesting migration soon... Going to go out and delete any non-default local accounts on all the servers
1278613748: <tinfoil> Will pretty much send an email out to all the applications teams saying they have until the end of the month to get an active-directory account built for any services they use, or things will break
1278613796: <tinfoil> Since we told them that this was the standard in January, Febuary, March, April, May, and June, I know this shouldn't be a problem

1278690782: <dp> 6.0.453.1 dev
1278690807: <dp> what package prodived the flashplayer that you have, do you know?
1278690882: <TeleCon> Not at that system anymore.
1278690899: <TeleCon> But, I believe it was the straight up adobe plugin installer.
1278690918: <dp> hrm
1278690932: <TeleCon> might be medibuntu sourced, but that's it.
1278693359: <acr0nym> All I can say is that if a smokin' hot 21-year old student employee offers you a "cupcake", it should be metaphorical, or innuendo, not an actual cupcake.
1278694005: <milkchan> i thought chrome came with it's own built in flash now?
1278694019: <milkchan> Shockwave Flash

1278694484: <TeleCon> acr0nym: Yeah\
1278694528: <]3d0g> the cupcake was a lie, was it?
1278694555: <acr0nym> No, dammit, it was a cupcake.
1278694840: <dp> acr0nym: hahahahahahahaha
1278694857: <dp> sorry, but that's funny shit
1278694885: * milkchan blinks
1278694887: <dp> TeleCon: could you put that up somewhere for me to fetch?
1278694914: <TeleCon> not until I get home tonight.
1278694989: <TeleCon> actually
1278694992: <TeleCon> I can
1278695006: <dp> dropbox?
1278695016: <dp> or you could just email it to me ;)
1278695076: <TeleCon> are you on ubuntu?
1278695096: <TeleCon> apt-get install flashplugin-installer
1278695127: <dp> installing
1278695150: <dp> done; now?

1278700659: <acr0nym> Hah!  Nice.

1278700829: <acr0nym> Looks like "Bellevue, WA"
1278700840: <acr0nym> Like you're in "Lyndhurst, NJ"
1278701252: <acr0nym> Heh, now, THIS is funny: http://www.mancaveworldwide.com/  (Look for Penn & Teller on the right-hand side)
1278701375: <acr0nym> The current Penn & Teller "Bullshit" is about "easy money" through MLM....
1278701380: <acr0nym> They were a big target on the show.
1278703197: <acr0nym> Awesome!  I'm thinkin' to myself, "I need rubber gloves for tonight!" and I look over at my bookshelf, and there's a whole box of rubber gloves!
1278703226: <]3d0g> woah. TMI buddy.
1278703285: <acr0nym> Heh, I was starting to wonder if people were paying attention at all.
1278703360: <milkchan> rubber gloves alone aren't troubling
1278703386: <milkchan> it's when the next thing you're looking for is what would traditionally be used for camping/rapelling or water based lube in addition to said gloves
1278703413: <acr0nym> Actually, the next thing I was looking for was a pocket protector....
1278703439: <milkchan> that would be a cool brand name for geek themed condoms
1278703486: <acr0nym> Heh, true.
1278703526: <TeleCon> Um

1278703650: <milkchan> schrodingers cat o nine tails
1278703666: <acr0nym> Wow.  Well done.
1278703692: <milkchan> i thought it was poison, not grilling that killed the cat potentially
1278703799: <acr0nym> Heh.
1278704121: <acr0nym> I am slightly startled that no one wonders why I have a box of latex gloves in my office.
1278704354: <milkchan> isn't it obvious?  you don't want to leave fingerprints on metaphorical cupcakes
1278704408: <acr0nym> Heh.
1278704414: <acr0nym> Actually, it's "fountain pen ink", but, so close.
1278704454: <milkchan> that would definitely cause noticable fingerprints
1278705037: <acr0nym> Indeed.

1278946243: <]3d0g> exactly. Zuck made public all those jailbat's pics. 
1278946252: <]3d0g> jailbait too
1278946284: <milkchan> see this is how i know i'm over the hill officially - i thought all the jailbait was still on myspace
1278946297: <]3d0g> I *do* prefer buzz and wish I  could just post there and have it flow to FB, but not possible.
1278946315: <milkchan> will it flow to twitter?
1278946321: <]3d0g> nopw
1278946343: <milkchan> i enjoy twitter lurking.  there are orgs and people that do make announcements that don't suck and that i do care about
1278946346: <milkchan> very few
1278946347: <]3d0g> the other direction fine but I don't like twitter
1278946435: <]3d0g> twitter to me only makes sense in shared events (like DEFCON) or for real-time search.
1278946508: <]3d0g> I got beta access to the new digg. It's WAY improved. Like a cross between FB and Goog reader.
1278946512: <milkchan> i follow EFF, defcon, and cyanogen

1278946526: <milkchan> yah
1278946535: <milkchan> and mike but that just pisses me off seeing he has a life and i dont
1278946545: <milkchan> the bank account balance doesn't quite make up for it
1278946568: <milkchan> oh oh.... liberal and conservative think tanks have put out a deflation warning
1278946586: <]3d0g> I'm following 17 but I only see 2-3 posts a day from that
1278946603: <]3d0g> yaay! Bargains galore!
1278946626: <milkchan> if you're sitting on cash like me you're in great shape
1278946650: <milkchan> i'm sitting on so much my damn 401k advisor called me an idiot
1278946658: <]3d0g> I should've paid more attention to the mrs interest in gold over the past years. 
1278946673: <milkchan> what's gold prices doing?
1278946675: <milkchan> still going up?
1278946692: <]3d0g> yup. officially reached ludicrous. 
1278946702: <milkchan> though if deflation hits, anyone that owns "things" - even gold
1278946706: <milkchan> will see a reduction in their value
1278946711: <milkchan> cash is king 
1278946712: <]3d0g> yup
1278946732: <milkchan> i'm kinda hoping for it now
1278946749: <milkchan> was too lazy to decide where to invest the last few years so i've been pumping into cash accounts
1278946790: <]3d0g> I still dump everything into index funds.
1278946828: <milkchan> mind sharing your mix?  you do anything special or just dump it into s&p
1278946880: <]3d0g> my 401K is 100% S&P. The mrs. IRA we also max and split between S&P and a bond-based index.
1278946934: <milkchan> i was doing small cap domestic, large cap domestic, and large cap foreign.  got tired of the fucking fees and the roller coaster of seeing it do way better than the s&p at times and way worse at other times
1278946953: <]3d0g> it's the fees that piss me off
1278946966: <milkchan> it was a good mix of holdings but it didn't outperform once all the fees were factored in

1278958921: <milkchan> it doesnt?
1278958947: <milkchan> i have groups in empathy
1278958984: <milkchan> added a group called test and put dp in it
1278959187: <dp> no, that's a group of contacts
1278959246: <dp> contact grouping is creating a single "contact" that contains multiple users; IE, if you're on my IM client under 3 different accounts, this would group all 3 of those together under a single "milkchan" account
1278959259: <dp> this way, I only see one "milkchan", but can chat with any of them
1278959275: <milkchan> what if all three are there?  which one takes the commo?

1278959658: <dp> IIRC, if you r-click on a contact, and hit "expand", you can then drag another contact under it
1278959850: <milkchan> i never understood why the gtalk account tried logging on anyway if you didn't store or cache the password
1278959865: <milkchan> in pidgin

1279045923: <milkchan> whats been up with mike this week
1279047163: <acr0nym> dunno.
1279047198: <milkchan> hasn't been online, hasn't answered actual professional/work emails
1279047362: <acr0nym> Vacation?
1279047413: <milkchan> pretty shitty one if he's sitting in the kirkland office :D
1279047423: <acr0nym> Heh, mebbe he left his phone.
1279047484: <milkchan> i use www.google.com/ig to fix my position when i go out at nighgt
1279047491: <milkchan> turn it off on the celly
1279047497: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279047512: <milkchan> leave a browser up...  shows as still auto-updating and not a manually set position that way
1279047692: <milkchan> though when i'm being a real bitch, i set my location to inuvik mike zubko airport, inuvik, nt x0e, canada
1279047704: <acr0nym> Why there?
1279047712: <milkchan> have you seen there?
1279047717: <acr0nym> Nope.
1279047729: <milkchan> inuvik is accessable by the dempster highway
1279047740: <milkchan> one of the few roads you can drive north of the arctic circle
1279047775: <acr0nym> Hrm.
1279047790: <milkchan> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dempster_Highway
1279047806: <milkchan> i will be getting a used range rover and i will take a few months off to drive it
1279047824: <milkchan> i've at least dipped my toe in every one of the world's oceans except the arctic
1279047840: <milkchan> so from inuvik, i can rent a chopper and hang out on the north slope beach
1279047846: <milkchan> in the summer, it's actually doable
1279047871: <milkchan> 50-60 deg F
1279047889: <acr0nym> Long drive.
1279047894: <milkchan> if you want to go in the winter, you can actually drive all the way to the ocean
1279047908: <milkchan> over ice roads so i'm too chicken shit for that
1279048107: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279048116: <acr0nym> Yeah, that'd be a bit unnerving.
1279048336: <milkchan> plus i wanna go somewhere exotic that doesn't require a huge amt of survival skills
1279048354: <milkchan> don't feel like hiking out of somewhere during the winter
1279048361: <acr0nym> Dude, just go to Toronto
1279048364: <acr0nym> Sheesh.
1279048400: <milkchan> been there.  great fucking food.  it's like NYC with a working health and safety inspectorate
1279048409: <acr0nym> Heh, exactly.

1279048424: <milkchan> best spring rolls i ever had too
1279048452: <milkchan> mike would be jealous.  i got to visit northbound leather in person
1279048600: <milkchan> was hoping to go to montreal this week
1279048732: <acr0nym> Why?

1279060600: <milkchan> i'm wondering how our paper money has survived the americans with disabilities act
1279061126: <dp> milkchan: did you see the decision by the NJSC?
1279061140: <dp> about the breath test?
1279061192: <milkchan> yes.  i believe they tossed the bit about the extra penalty regarding refusal of the test - not the enitre conviction
1279061241: <dp> did you see that the police will now have to play a recording in up to 9 different languages, so that the subject can understand what happens if they refuse?
1279061447: <milkchan> yep
1279061450: <dp> crazy
1279061485: <milkchan> though i like the bit about "being too drunk to understand this in any language is still not a defense"
1279061491: <dp> ;)
1279061571: <milkchan> though i feel having a requirement that government business be performed in one, maybe 2 languages at most is a reasonable requirement.  you can exempt non citizens from penalties of not understanding
1279061586: <milkchan> but a citizen?  you should know the language to be a permanant resident using the roads
1279061596: <milkchan> or one of a select list of official ones at least
1279061615: <dp> you would think so ;)

1279137486: <fbx> more importantly, why is a rack supported by a single 20A circuit?

1279138076: <]3d0g> fbx: 2 circuits per rack. they're supposed to tell me when any one exceeds 10A.
1279138103: <fbx> got it. still...why not 30A per? budget?

1279141573: <tinfoil> So far, it's been pretty cool
1279141627: <tinfoil> It did a playlist that went from folk to downtempo to techno to ambient that actually worked
1279141658: <TeleCon> I only use android for podcasts.  Almost never for music.
1279141716: <tinfoil> Oh, the other feature I like is like the iphone, it has controls to skip/pause in the lock screen

1279221739: <acr0nym> Mebbe there's a spam configuration somewhere....
1279221765: <acr0nym> Yep, there is.
1279221791: <acr0nym> "Amazon.com Communications"
1279221797: <acr0nym> E-mail Notifications
1279221797: <acr0nym> Note: even if you opt out of some e-mails below, you will still receive transactional e-mail, such as messages related to orders, listings, and bids.
1279221807: <acr0nym> Do not send me e-mail
1279221808: <acr0nym> Check this box to stop receiving all Amazon.com communcations (except transactional e-mails). This will also terminate Amazon.com Delivers subscriptions. 
1279221817: <acr0nym> Heh, nice!  A typo!
1279221822: <acr0nym> "communcations"
1279221960: <-- milkchan-cell has quit (Quit: Bye)
1279222111: --> tinfoil (unknown@61EEB1AB.9D801894.1EB2E28.IP) has joined #lobby
1279222127: <tinfoil> hello from irsso
1279222130: <tinfoil> irssi
1279222201: <dp> finally
1279222217: <tinfoil> I had to jump a few hoops
1279222221: <tinfoil> I won't stay on much
1279222595: <dp> ?
1279222611: <dp> I can set up a :443 ssh account for you if you want...
1279223013: <tinfoil> I'm able to connect to my home machine
1279223042: <tinfoil> just had to set up dynamic dns and then found out my standalone wimax modem is actually a firewall/router
1279223062: <tinfoil> had to find the default password then tell it to pass everything to my firewall
1279223099: <tinfoil> openvpn is working now
1279223105: <tinfoil> ssh is working
1279224037: <tinfoil> ...anyway
1279224141: <tinfoil> So we have RSA Envision for log management/corelation.  It's licensed by events per second.  The license is a soft limit, then there is a hard ceiling after which it won't let you access the logs you're recording
1279224171: <tinfoil> Well, Envision itself had an error, creating 7 *million* errors per minute
1279224179: <tinfoil> which is well above our license
1279224201: <tinfoil> So we couldn't even find out what the errors were because it wouldn't let us view them
1279224209: <tinfoil> cute, eh?
1279224263: <tinfoil> So 4 days on the phone with support, they have my co-worker hack into the server to figure out what they errors are and then figure out a way to fix it...
1279224304: <tinfoil> a week later, we're still getting about 10K errors/min from envision
1279224315: <tinfoil> which is counted against our license
1279224691: <acr0nym> Hah! http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs199.snc4/38297_1501354183406_1520737842_31283652_7050462_n.jpg
1279224719: <acr0nym> Hrmm, I'm pretty sure that I already HAVE a :443 SSH account for tinfoil.  ;)
1279224751: <acr0nym> Oh, nope, wrong.  That listen address got turned off again.  Heh.
1279224899: <tinfoil> I'll remove it from my ssh config then
1279224914: <tinfoil> acr0nym: connection reset by peer
1279225023: <acr0nym> Heh, exactly.  I can prolly turn it back on, if you want.
1279225025: <dp> hrm; I'm looking at the logs of an SMTP session;  I see the DATA line, whereby the server responds with "Please start mail input".  The next line is a dot.  I know that the dot ends the mail, but does that mean that nothing was in the message?
1279225033: <acr0nym> dp: Yes.
1279225039: <dp> hrm
1279225048: <dp> curious
1279225068: <tinfoil> acr0nym: connection reset by peer was refering to the URL
1279225076: <dp> so then when the server responds "250 Mail queued for delivery", then the server is in control from that point, right?
1279225108: <acr0nym> Oh, weird, wonder if it requires a facebook login that actually has access.
1279225124: <tinfoil> I'm logged into facebook
1279225141: <tinfoil> connection reset by peer is pre-auth
1279225167: <tinfoil> dp:  the client can follow up with a new mail attempt
1279225180: <tinfoil> MAIL FROM/RCPT TO/DATA
1279225195: <acr0nym> screw it: http://www.acr0nym.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_itemId=3956
1279225204: <tinfoil> Else, common functionality is to QUIT (or some drop connection without QUIT)
1279225238: <tinfoil> acr0nym: ... That's wrong
1279225246: <acr0nym> In which respect?
1279225281: <tinfoil> anyone who brings up clippy is sick and depraved
1279225294: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279225297: <acr0nym> I think it's funny.
1279225313: <tinfoil> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigor
1279225344: <acr0nym> Heh, nice.
1279225457: <tinfoil> It was evil
1279225463: <tinfoil> "Are you sure you want to move left?
1279225473: <tinfoil> etc
1279225519: <acr0nym> Heh, nice: "Ha ha, circus circus just offered me rooms for $21. Fuck you circus circus- never again."
1279225637: <tinfoil> they would have to pay me more than $21/night to stay there
1279225655: <tinfoil> I might accept $200/night
1279225762: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279225788: <tinfoil> I remember Zio was partial to their private entrance rooms
1279225792: <tinfoil> no casino
1279225799: <acr0nym> Yeah, "Cabanas" or some such.
1279225892: <acr0nym> Hah!  I've been invited to the MSRC party for Black Hat....
1279226003: <tinfoil> Hah
1279226020: <tinfoil> How did you manage that?
1279226032: <tinfoil> I bet they would try to walk me out if I even came close
1279226034: <acr0nym> Speaker Proctoring for the Briefings.
1279226045: <acr0nym> Getting all kinds of whacky invites.
1279226073: <tinfoil> Bleh
1279226085: <tinfoil> I was told for months I could go
1279226096: <tinfoil> but the budget was never approved
1279226131: <tinfoil> It works out, since I'm at Critical Massive all next week
1279226135: <tinfoil> and the following weekend
1279226174: <acr0nym> Oh, jeebus, you're turning into a burner?
1279226182: <tinfoil> Turning?
1279226197: <acr0nym> Oh, jeebus, you're a burner?
1279226204: <fbx> heh
1279226251: <tinfoil> And that surprises you why?
1279226266: <acr0nym> Dunno, I guess....
1279226286: <tinfoil> I founded a camp last summer
1279226441: <acr0nym> At Burning Man, or Critical Massive?
1279226452: <tinfoil> Yes
1279226486: <tinfoil> Camp de Sade trandsends the local/global barrier
1279226513: <tinfoil> :-p
1279226521: <tinfoil> Honestly, I was bored and unemployed
1279226531: <tinfoil> it just happened to be successful
1279226679: <tinfoil> I was told we were one of the most organized camps last summer by the CM organizers.  It shows how much I can pull off when I do focus, perhaps.  :-)
1279226688: <tinfoil> This year, I let someone else run it
1279226690: * tinfoil is lazy
1279227116: <tinfoil> It's very hard to hang out in seattle and not hang out with burners.  Aparently the only city that's worse is SF
1279227230: <tinfoil> acr0nym: Forgot to tell you, Johan is at Coalfire
1279227237: <acr0nym> Hah!  WTF?
1279227250: <tinfoil> yeah
1279227275: <acr0nym> Why?
1279227283: <tinfoil> Tony's word's "Do you guys have any openenings?  Johan slumped so low to end up at Coalfire and I'm worried about him."
1279227286: <tinfoil> No idea
1279227290: <tinfoil> I just asked him
1279227296: <acr0nym> Heh, yikes.
1279227355: <fbx> ok, so what's so bad about coalfire? you all seem to hate the place
1279227389: <tinfoil> Look up abusive in the dictionary and it will refer you to coalfire
1279227411: <tinfoil> The two engineers that lasted the longest there:  me - 2 years, acr0nym - 9 months
1279227426: <tinfoil> everyone else left in 3weeks to 3 months
1279227445: <tinfoil> they exhaused the engineers in colorado (the ones who didn't work there heard the stories)
1279227459: <tinfoil> so they started getting H1B candidates who couldn't leave so quickly
1279227466: <tinfoil> and college interns
1279227527: <tinfoil> I made less money than my entry level job (6 years before), had no benefits, and worked 80+ hour weeks
1279227557: <tinfoil> was recalled from a weekend long vacation 2 days early (just arrived) to work on a project, and never refunded money for the return ticket
1279227580: <fbx> coalfiresystems.com?
1279227593: <tinfoil> yes
1279227611: <fbx> rick the biggest dick there?
1279227612: <tinfoil> acr0nym: Do you want to add?
1279227615: <tinfoil> yes
1279227624: <tinfoil> He is the biggest dick, period
1279227665: <tinfoil> I offered to create the colorado infragard's website
1279227671: <tinfoil> Coalfire didn't want anything to do with it
1279227679: <tinfoil> then Rick ran for president of the board and won
1279227680: <tinfoil> I quit
1279227685: <tinfoil> and they threatened to sue me for the website
1279227762: <tinfoil> They went after someone acr0nym and I know for leaving with propriatary methodologies
1279227768: <fbx> they sound like peaches
1279227785: <fbx> methodologies?
1279227793: <tinfoil> Yet on all the proposals they gave clients, it said we used open sourced/best practice methodologies
1279227803: <fbx> unless it's really out there, how does one patent a methodology?
1279227830: <fbx> and if it's good, it's usually best practice
1279227836: <fbx> and widely adopted
1279227845: <fbx> also..not patented!
1279227872: <tinfoil> They just didn't want him competing
1279227898: <tinfoil> The owners son was my boss
1279227907: <fbx> you can't deprive someone of a living, especially if what you're using is "best practice in an industry"
1279227926: <tinfoil> I had 5 clients, and he had 2.  He prioritized one of them and dropped the other
1279227946: <tinfoil> When the report was due, I was chewed out by the owner in front of the entire office for fucking it up
1279227962: <tinfoil> I forget what he said, but it was very, very, degrading
1279227973: <fbx> ok, ok...i get it
1279227979: <tinfoil> pretty much everyone else there (ack acro) was impressed I didn't quit
1279227989: <tinfoil> I can keep going on
1279227990: <tinfoil> :-)
1279227998: <fbx> sounds like
1279228001: <fbx> i get the picture
1279228034: <acr0nym> Yeah....
1279228039: <acr0nym> The place was truly awful.
1279228061: <acr0nym> Everybody I know who works with them eventually ends up feeling the way Mike and I do.
1279228122: <tinfoil> acr0nym: I told you that a brief encounter with a shrink talking about that place and she said I likely suffered PTSD as a result of working there
1279228125: <tinfoil> ?
1279228131: <acr0nym> Hah!  No, but, it sounds likely.
1279228706: <tinfoil> Wow, I'm getting serious flashbacks from that place now
1279228707: <tinfoil> bleh
1279228715: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279228828: <acr0nym> I've got to admit, this looks very interesting: http://io9.com/5588088/new-trailer-for-the-social-network-is-classic-scifi-techno+tragedy
1279229502: <tinfoil> Man, chrome on 64bit ubuntu is great, except when it comes to flash
1279229674: <tinfoil> Anyone see "Predators" yet?
1279229712: <tinfoil> It's raited significantly higher than Airbender (which still gets worse reviews than any of the Twilight moves)
1279229779: <tinfoil> Actually, I think sex in the city 2 was better rated than Airbender
1279230410: <acr0nym> Heh.  And...
1279230419: * acr0nym has left the building
1279231969: <-- ]3d0g has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
1279288240: <fbx> if airbender had any integrity towards the original, it might score better
1279288250: <fbx> but it's fucking m night shamalame
1279288261: <fbx> don't expect "excellent"
1279288293: <fbx> in fact, i'm starting to think of him in the same vein as michael bay: don't go see their shit, because it's not fertilizer, it's shit
1279289335: <dp> agreed
1279293990: * acr0nym concurs
1279294406: --> Geist (root@dp-27EE8524.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) has joined #lobby
1279294528: <-- Geist has quit (Quit: Leaving)
1279294885: <acr0nym> WTF?
1279294888: <acr0nym> Dammit.
1279294891: <acr0nym> I wanted to talk to him.
1279295254: --> Geist (johan@dp-27EE8524.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) has joined #lobby
1279295262: <acr0nym> Yo!  Han!  Heh.
1279295268: <Geist> yo ho
1279295276: <Geist> found my way in again
1279295282: <acr0nym> Nice.
1279295289: <acr0nym> You've got my number, right?  Why didn't you just call me?  Heh.
1279295296: <Geist> doing a project for them
1279295310: <acr0nym> Heh, that was a private message....  ;)
1279295313: <Geist> lost my whole db
1279295326: <acr0nym> Of phone numbers?
1279295334: <Geist> ye
1279295357: <acr0nym> Here's mine, again, then:  303-588-9077.
1279295365: <Geist> you going to defcon?
1279295368: <Geist> kk 
1279295370: <acr0nym> Jah.  You?
1279295383: --> ]3d0g (jkarp@6988929A.F4AE6A51.BF63E968.IP) has joined #lobby
1279295383: <PipSqueek> ]3d0g: Prost!
1279295392: <Geist> yup
1279295399: <acr0nym> Nice.
1279295405: <Geist> airfare was only $150
1279295426: <acr0nym> I'm drivin', as usual.
1279295453: <Geist> figured
1279295466: <Geist> check my new linux phone out
1279295469: <Geist> http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_n900-2917.php
1279295482: <Geist> got ubuntu running on it
1279295489: <acr0nym> Geist: http://www.tno.org/tp/dc/dc18.txt
1279295541: <acr0nym> And, if you have time, you should consider b-sides: http://www.securitybsides.com/BSidesLasVegas
1279295586: <Geist> cool
1279295603: <acr0nym> What else are you up to, besides slumming with CFS?
1279295622: <Geist> oh my new cell# 720-247-0919
1279295647: <Geist> building InfoSec infrastructure for a few medical companies
1279295662: <Geist> and national park service for nps
1279295669: <Geist> coalfire ehh
1279295684: <Geist> got to audit all the national parks
1279295690: <Geist> lol 
1279295697: <acr0nym> Cool.  You run into Eddie Mize at all?  Exempla?
1279295710: <Geist> nah
1279295715: <Geist> not yet
1279295763: <acr0nym> He's a good friend of mine, so lemme know, if you do.
1279295770: <Geist> sure
1279295863: <acr0nym> When are you hitting the pavement in Vegas?
1279295872: <Geist> leaving Thu Night
1279295881: <acr0nym> Ah, so, you won't be in town for B-sides, then.
1279295882: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279295907: <Geist> nah, didnt know
1279295908: <acr0nym> I've heard fairly interesting things about the Nokia N900.  How do you like it?
1279295912: <Geist> maybe next time
1279295916: <Geist> looks interesting
1279295923: <acr0nym> Yeah, they really are.
1279295930: <acr0nym> And, the location for this year looks absurd.
1279295936: <acr0nym> http://www.2810vegasestate.com/
1279295936: <Geist> luv the phone. comes with ssh as default
1279295968: <acr0nym> Cool.
1279295982: <acr0nym> I'm carrying a Nexus One currently, and quite pleased.
1279295983: <Geist> got metasploit running on the n900 among wireshark, nmpap, openvas and other default tools
1279295987: <acr0nym> Heh, nice!
1279296091: <Geist> I tried to install OSX on it, but having some trouble with it
1279296115: <acr0nym> Heh, yeah, that seems appropriate.
1279296137: <Geist> just wanna see how far you can push it
1279296253: <acr0nym> Fair enough.
1279296536: <Geist> do you have a ninja badge or can you get one?
1279296622: <acr0nym> Uh, no, and, I dunno.
1279296623: <acr0nym> Why?
1279296664: <Geist> some buds where going to the ninjaa party and you need a badge to get in
1279296679: <Geist> its free 
1279296696: <Geist> but you need to find sum1 with badges
1279296728: <acr0nym> Ah, it's Saturday night....  I'll prolly skip it, even if I get a badge.
1279296736: <acr0nym> That's the night of the Freakshow AND the 303 party.
1279296799: <acr0nym> Only so many parties can be attended.
1279296800: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279296809: <Geist> ye true lol
1279296833: <acr0nym> Especially since the guy who organizes the infogoons apparently thinks I'm a morning guy.  All of my shifts start at 8 a.m.
1279296836: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279297410: <TeleCon> Ouch
1279297417: <TeleCon> I don't know what mine are yet.
1279297435: <acr0nym> Ah, you'll be random.  You're security.
1279297574: <TeleCon> OK
1279297583: <acr0nym> Well, that's my guess anyway.
1279297584: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279297596: <acr0nym> BIAB, got a meeting.
1279300922: <TeleCon> food
1279300929: --- TeleCon is now known as telegone
1279301308: <tinfoil> Is this an insane idea... pushing our app-teams to roll their applications into RPM's
1279301324: <tinfoil> (one at a time)
1279301863: <tinfoil> The idea is that the developers should be able to re-reply their application on any server with minimal local configuration - and all the dependencies should be accounted for
1279301874: <tinfoil> (either custom rolled or standard)
1279302285: <tinfoil> The other reason I'm thinking of pushing for that is that we can then put the RPM's into a central repo, making upgrades and rollbacks easier.
1279303026: <acr0nym> Blargh.
1279303515: <acr0nym> Ah, sweet, a new rollout of Facebook GUI.  Bring on the whining!
1279303559: <fbx> waaaah! they broke <insert app/config/whatever here>!
1279303938: <tinfoil> 99% of the apps need to be deleted
1279303968: <tinfoil> Facebook apps are like drug dealers
1279303970: <dp> agreed
1279303980: <tinfoil> Everyone you block one, another shows up in your feed
1279303984: <dp> er, not about drug dealers ;)
1279304289: <tinfoil> Too late, you already agreed
1279304292: <tinfoil> ;-)
1279304654: <acr0nym> Quick opinion:  Car stereo, comparable Kenwood vs. Sony.  Discuss!
1279305121: <acr0nym> FUCK YOU ALL.
1279305630: <dp> acr0nym: crutchfield.com
1279305900: <fbx> hey! my buddy used to work for them here in c-ville
1279305932: <fbx> he knows bill crutchfield, in fact
1279306067: <acr0nym> That's where I'm buying....
1279306071: <acr0nym> Just two pretty similar models.
1279306307: <acr0nym> And, I decided on Kenwood.
1279307258: <Geist> Sony is always overpriced
1279307527: <tinfoil> Sony goes through cycles of being amazingly good to expensive crap
1279307536: <tinfoil> and you never know which end you'll end up with
1279307547: <tinfoil> Rarely do they end up in the middle
1279307594: <tinfoil> then again, I'm still pissed off about my VaIO PictureBook
1279307640: <Geist> Expensively Amazingley Good to Expensive Crappily Crap
1279307655: <tinfoil> within a month of the warrenty expiring, the first hardrive failed - All 3 brand new hard drives I purchased after that all failed within 2 weeks of installation
1279307692: <Geist> thats cause you are Mr. Acidfingers
1279307737: <tinfoil> :-p
1279307743: <tinfoil> I see you have time to IRC these days
1279307761: <Geist> lol 
1279307776: <Geist> enumerating PEDs 
1279307785: <fbx> pedo what? huh?
1279307793: <fbx> pedoGeist?
1279307794: <Geist> Payment terminals
1279307809: * fbx doesn't know Geist well enough to really call him a pedo
1279307812: <Geist> and some POS too
1279307815: <fbx>  sorry dude
1279307828: <Geist> Point of Sale not Piece of Shit
1279307836: <fbx> no, no...i got that
1279308003: <tinfoil> Depends, Piece of Shit and Point of Sale are not mutually exclusive
1279308018: <Geist> indeed
1279308151: <dp> oi, fuckers
1279308259: <tinfoil> Damn cold.  Hate feeling mentally awake, but my body is physically fatigued
1279309552: <acr0nym> I think the Kenwood will work well.
1279309657: <telegone> What are you trying to do?
1279309688: <acr0nym> Replace the stock stereo in my car....
1279309733: <telegone> Ah
1279309743: <telegone> Did you find one that support replay gain?
1279309761: <acr0nym> Umm.  No, since I don't know what it is, I wasn't looking for it....
1279309797: <telegone> Lossless audio normalization 
1279309801: <telegone> No reencoding.
1279309817: <acr0nym> Hm.  That didn't help....
1279309825: <telegone> http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Replay_Gain
1279309832: <telegone> Replay Gain is the name of a technique invented to achieve the same playback volume of audio files. It specifies the reference level of 89dB and an algorithm to measure the perceived loudness of audio data.
1279309853: <acr0nym> Ah.  Yeah, I totally wasn't looking for that.  Because it's a car stereo.  In my car.
1279309889: <telegone> I have some files that require volume twiddling during playback.  It'd be nice.
1279309916: <acr0nym> I would need very, very good "road, passenger and wind" noise normalization before I even STARTED to worry about that.
1279309960: <acr0nym> This is what I bought: http://www.crutchfield.com/p_113BT645U/Kenwood-KDC-BT645U.html?search=113BT645U
1279310066: <acr0nym> Huh, it does seem to have a "highway sound" detector...
1279310067: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279310073: <telegone> nice
1279310078: <telegone> How mucish?
1279310085: <telegone> Oh, I could look to the right.
1279310087: <telegone> n/m
1279310087: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279310104: <acr0nym> It was right about 300, with stuff to hook up my steering wheel controls and 2nd day air shipping.
1279310149: <telegone> Why do these end up with the strange maximums that they have on files?
1279310170: <acr0nym> What's the maximum?  And, why does it matter?  How the hell do you organize your music?
1279310190: <telegone> Your USB device should only have a maximum of 8 directory levels, 255 folders, and 255 files per folder with a maximum of 65,025 files and folders.
1279310204: <telegone> I throw a bunch of files on a thumb drive.
1279310217: <acr0nym> It's probably a memory limitation.
1279310240: <telegone> freesoftware on an ipod nano does a better job.
1279310253: --- telegone is now known as telecon
1279310273: <telecon> Sansa and Apple do better with factory software
1279310336: <telecon> no hd radio.
1279310404: <telecon> Though, and ipod classic might work pretty well while plugged into that sucker.
1279310432: <telecon> I'd hate to have to install itunes on anything though.
1279310530: <acr0nym> Realistically, I expect that my phone will work pretty well for lots of things, plugged into that sucker.
1279310536: <acr0nym> Mounted as a drive.  Heh.
1279310581: <acr0nym> Mostly, I expect it to be a good bit better than the factory radio.  Heh.
1279310733: <acr0nym> Heh, kinda cool, apparently it shows SMS messages on the display through Bluetooth.
1279310806: <acr0nym> Oh, and it does, in fact, appear to have Bluetooth A2DP, which is poorly advertised on the Crutchfield site.
1279311442: <telecon> Bluetooth A2DP would be kind of nice.
1279311452: <telecon> Alleviates some of the other things I talked about.
1279311497: <tinfoil> You guys plays with MixZing on your android phones yet?
1279311507: <telecon> no
1279311521: <tinfoil> It offered a feature I really enjoy - being able to skip/pause tracks while the phone is locked
1279311551: <tinfoil> (like the iphone)
1279311557: <tinfoil> It comes in handy while driving
1279311571: <telecon> yeah
1279311574: <tinfoil> so I don't need to enter a pattern first
1279311749: <tinfoil> Sorry I'm repeating
1279311751: <tinfoil> damn I'm exhausted
1279311773: <telecon> :)
1279311841: <tinfoil> Did install Ubuntu 10 on my laptop last night
1279311851: <tinfoil> this time no strange pauses
1279311877: <tinfoil> Tonight, will try tethering my SLR camera to it
1279311927: <dp> hrm... gReader needs a way to flag something as spam
1279312181: <acr0nym> Wow, it is just fekkin' hot.
1279312204: <acr0nym> And, I believe A2DP can skip and pause tracks over bluetooth from the receiver face.
1279312326: <acr0nym> Heh, tempting: http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/mugs/96c6/
1279312421: <]3d0g> hey, they're back in stock! broke mine
1279312553: <acr0nym> Bummer.
1279312574: <]3d0g> they look fantastic when carrying around green tea :)
1279312579: <acr0nym> Heh, I bet.
1279312712: <]3d0g> sporting this one now http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/mugs/c7cc/
1279312724: <acr0nym> Heh, the Splenda's a lie!
1279312866: <acr0nym> This is kinda funny: http://www.boingboing.net/2010/07/16/rube-goldberg-rat-ru.html
1279312972: <]3d0g> it's like portal IRL
1279313123: <dp> wow...Cory is a little behind the times...
1279313134: <acr0nym> Ah, he's in England.
1279313157: <acr0nym> Heh.  What makes you say it?
1279313173: <dp> this video was released several weeks ago
1279313196: <acr0nym> Yeah, but, he didn't have to talk about buying one several weeks ago.
1279313239: <dp> true
1279313627: <]3d0g> weekend ensues.
1279313672: <dp> not yet

1279557131: <]3d0g> more than usual or you mean something technical?
1279557165: <acr0nym> Oh, technical.  Just having awful connections.
1279557175: <acr0nym> This video, however, is a RIOT: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn5jlrxcpkI
1279557611: <tinfoil> Upgraded The Lenovo X200s from Windows 7 to Ubuntu 10
1279557624: <tinfoil> needed to do something while home sick
1279557636: <tinfoil> it appears they fixed that weird delay that I was experiencing
1279558685: <ouiji> why is it that listening to police / fire / etc.. via a scanner is so kick ass? It almost has a soothing auroa
1279558792: <acr0nym> Heh: http://www.buzzfeed.com/awesomer/the-13-worst-mel-gibson-rant-quotes-presented-by

1279559148: <ouiji> I think jesus needs to go back to sunday school
1279559259: <ouiji> Jesus Gibson, that is. not the dude who worked with wood
1279559852: <ouiji> I really hope this doesn't turn into a trend.. the whole sex tape trend.. I don
1279559887: <ouiji> t have any issues with.. but if this becomes the "Next best way to get publicity"
1279559957: <ouiji> then ima be a mo fuckin star, i slap dem bitches and tells them theys hoes like on the daily
1279560568: <ouiji> "This just in! Tom Cruise announces that Mel Gibson has been de-sientologyfied and his seat on the TSS Cruse space rocket is now available !"

1279562759: <milkchan> anyone starting to catch the washington post coverage re: top secret america?
1279562784: <telecon> I just now heard about it, in another window.
1279562787: <acr0nym> Oh, you mean, this? http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/
1279562791: <acr0nym> Heh.

1279562977: <acr0nym> Yeah, I fear, myself, that the consequences will never be the same.
1279563012: <]3d0g> God bless Anon.
1279563028: <acr0nym> I'm wrong.  I believe "The Gathering of the Juggalos" requires a MOAB: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOAB
1279563101: <]3d0g> Ah, so apparently, 3 torrents and a 10MB/s d/l of the RHEL 5.5 DVD is the point where Firefox gets pissed. Noted.
1279563104: <milkchan> two of those would cure the new york and philadelphia metro area of almost 95% of all suck
1279563110: <milkchan> one on seaside heights NJ
1279563116: <milkchan> that would take care of ny metro guidos
1279563117: <acr0nym> Torrent?  Firefox is a torrent handler now/
1279563118: <acr0nym> ?
1279563121: <milkchan> the other on wildwood nj
1279563127: <milkchan> that would take care of philly area guidos
1279563138: <]3d0g> Well, it hands off to Transmission
1279563146: <acr0nym> Ah.
1279563250: <acr0nym> Ah, may need to figure out how to make one of these for myself: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM8g6Zz4LOE
1279563305: <tinfoil> Bleh, may need to re-flash my droid
1279563446: <milkchan> gonna try cyanogen on it?
1279563463: <tinfoil> Will it work on a phone with absolutely no firmware on it?
1279563482: <milkchan> no clue.  i run a nexus 
1279563491: <milkchan> sposedly they have cm ported to the droid
1279563493: <tinfoil> it boots and tells me it has no firmware and to connect it to a PC to boot
1279563531: <tinfoil> No joke, less than 1tsp of water hit it to do this
1279563686: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: You'll prolly wanna go through this, also: http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/atheists-conduct-de-baptisms/story?id=11109379
1279563727: <]3d0g> already have my hairdryer picked out.
1279563733: <acr0nym> Nice!
1279563794: <acr0nym> Also good: http://www.break.com/index/door_to_door_atheists_bother_mormons.html
1279564027: <]3d0g> Wouldn't Jehovah's Witnesses be better? I don't recall Mormons being terribly evangelical. 
1279564045: <acr0nym> Umm.
1279564060: <acr0nym> You realize that all Mormon men take on a 2-year mission?  To proselytize?
1279564106: <acr0nym> They are worse than Witnesses.
1279564106: <]3d0g> nope. Not that I pay ANY mass-delusion much notice however.
1279564201: <acr0nym> Ah, well, there you have it.
1279564450: <milkchan> http://wonkette.com/416730/maureen-dowd-on-rapey-priests - wow.  one of the best wonkette posts actually wasn't that funny
1279564517: <]3d0g> well fuck. how'd I miss the announcement google pulled public calendar search. 
1279564550: <]3d0g> was handy having all of the DC schedule on the phone last year.
1279564570: <tinfoil> public calendar search?
1279564590: <tinfoil> Also, google often makes changes without announcements
1279564627: <]3d0g> no, they made an announcement back in feb. guess none of the feeds I follow bothered to cover it.
1279564718: <]3d0g> Oh, Inception is excellent, BTW.
1279564730: <tinfoil> The trailors were incredibly vague
1279564900: <]3d0g> they need to be, really. Incredibly simple premise but the plot gets extremely complex.
1279565675: <tinfoil> Is that another one of those reality within a reality within a reality movies?
1279565752: <]3d0g> it's all about dreams
1279565992: <acr0nym> oneiric social engineering
1279566796: <milkchan> evangelism is the sincerest form of insecurity
1279566857: <fbx> depends...i evangelize good products every now and then. i don't consider that through the lens of insecurity
1279566874: <fbx> religion? well...that's a totally different matter
1279567908: <]3d0g> I always found the Jehovah's Witnesses evangelicalism rather ironic as their heaven only has so many seats to take :)
1279568709: <tinfoil> One thing I loved about my house in colorado was having the 6ft gate that was locked from the inside
1279568724: <tinfoil> Every time they would come to bother us they couldn't get in
1279568765: <tinfoil> one time they kept saying "We're here to give you a message from god."    and then try to open the gate.  As if that would unlock it
1279569725: <tinfoil> We implemented a new VPN and set up the ACL's to only access the IT supported datacenters, nothing more
1279569739: <acr0nym> And, it got slower?
1279569740: <tinfoil> What an uproar it's causing
1279569761: <tinfoil> We're finding out just how many people run servers under their desk
1279569766: <acr0nym> Hah!
1279569768: <acr0nym> Nice.
1279569802: <tinfoil> "We're sorry, that's not a IT supported production server.  If you would like this device managed by IT Ops, please submit the justification form and budget approval to xxxxx
1279569847: <tinfoil> The other big thing is for the 2010 policy is that we're not allowing remote access to any devices not supported by itops
1279569858: <tinfoil> that includes home machines (with exception to OWA)
1279569890: <tinfoil> So, we're getting a couple tickets a day asking how to support the new vpn on people's home amchines
1279570199: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279570200: <acr0nym> Nice.
1279571478: <tinfoil> What's really cool is that we installed CompuTrace on all corporate assets.
1279571488: <tinfoil> along with PGP full disk encryption
1279571507: <tinfoil> asset gets stolen, we mark it as stolen in computrace and the machine gets locked out at the BIOS level
1279571521: <tinfoil> Assuming it ever pops online
1279571574: <tinfoil> The catch is, if it's stolen by someone who re-installed windows over the PGP encrypted volume, computrace reinstalls itself transparently and then once it gets internet connectivity it reports in as our asset and then gets locked out
1279571613: <tinfoil> Someone gets terminated, their assets get locked immediatly
1279571635: <tinfoil> The nice thing about the BIOS lockout is that once it's locked you can't even install linux on it
1279571656: <tinfoil> Our security team needs to unlock it
1279573161: <acr0nym> Yannow, I'll be honest.  I'd LOVE it if Clarke's Satan-shaped aliens showed up....  Nevertheless, in 2010, how the FUCK can people not tell the difference between a parachute flare and a spacecraft?
1279573182: <acr0nym> Also, entertaining: http://www.leiasmetalbikini.com/LMB_BikiniColorOptions.jpg
1279574084: <tinfoil> acr0nym: What makes you ask about the flare?
1279574365: <tinfoil> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_boy_hoax  Your comment made me think of this.  Wow I knew it was a hoax, but that is seriously fucked up stuff
1279574477: <acr0nym> Oh, I was watching the Penn & Teller "Bullshit!" on Area 51, etc.....
1279574488: <acr0nym> They had a shot of a "triangular" craft....  You can finish that story.
1279574543: <acr0nym> And, yes, that Heene crap is just completely retarded.
1279574554: <acr0nym> I wonder if the douchetard is actually paying restitution.
1279574670: <acr0nym> Also as a side note:  Limestone-based paper SUCKS.
1279574744: <tinfoil> limestone based paper?
1279574997: <acr0nym> http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=limestone+paper
1279575040: <acr0nym> Also http://www.terraskin.com/
1279575130: <acr0nym> AAAAND, that's enough for me.

1279579793: <tinfoil> The extended setting plugin?

1279579801: <tinfoil> install it it might be an option
1279579962: <ouiji> haha, now that is funny. I just had a link sent to me thas on some celeb website.. the title of it was "Child stars, then and now".. the link was of dakota fanning, and in the "about blurb" it said somthing about her controversial roll that involves child abuse.. and below the picture of her, was the "post a comment" box.. nothing funny there right? 
1279580068: <ouiji> but to post a comment, it had the enter these letters to prove your a person captcha or whatever it's called..
1279580098: <ouiji> and the *random* letters were "R kelly"

1279731603: <tinfoil> eXistenZ and Inception both do what matrix failed at.
1279731631: <tinfoil> That being said, Matrix was a great first movie - the other two ruined the series

1279736281: <tinfoil> to top it off they started creating them within the same UID/GID range of LDAP
1279736302: <tinfoil> causing conflicts
1279736317: <tinfoil> Little local account - you know... like oracle
1279736351: <tinfoil> On some of the servers oracle has my UID
1279736355: <tinfoil> morons
1279736769: <canadachan> you running nscd on your machines that use ldap?
1279736828: <tinfoil> No
1279736842: <tinfoil> Err, correction, yes
1279738672: <tinfoil> Just did an audit of all the hosts.  100 local accounts across all servers conflict with LDAP
1279738984: <canadachan> what id # do you start the ldap range at?
1279739437: <tinfoil> 10001 - me
1279739493: <tinfoil> It was the recommended starting ID by the head linux admin at the time
1279739546: <canadachan> don't most redhats manually assign ids starting at 500?
1279739596: <canadachan> in which case you have to be a pretty serious fucknut to conflict with the ldap range
1279739672: <tinfoil> My boss was impressed with how fast I was able to audit the hosts  :-)
1279739702: <tinfoil> I run a script weekly that drops my keys on any new linux hosts

1279742870: <canadachan> did health care reform extend coverage to all americans?
1279742883: <]3d0g> in 2014, yes

1279742980: <canadachan> In 2014, everyone must purchase health insurance or face a $695 annual fine. There are some exceptions for low-income people.
1279743001: <canadachan> so no.  everyone must BUY insurance or be fined
1279743031: <]3d0g> point being?
1279743048: <]3d0g> canadians must BUY theirs too. Same with brits.
1279743077: <]3d0g> and neither of those have exemptions for low-income.
1279743096: <fbx> well, all americans must buy insurance from a private, for-profit insurance company
1279743103: <fbx> which is not really the way i'd like to see it
1279743105: <canadachan> single payer government plans - that's more a tax than a "you must buy private insurance"
1279743139: <fbx> well, the buying key is americans are buying from for-profit private companies only
1279743145: <]3d0g> oh, 100% agreed, but you can thank the republican fear of "socialism" for the killing of single-payer.
1279743151: <fbx> not quite the same in canada and the UK
1279743168: <fbx> yeah, that's socialism like i'm the fucking jolly green giant
1279743175: <fbx> so agreed
1279743176: <canadachan> pay for isn't exactly the same thing as buy
1279743215: <canadachan> just like we paid for wall street - we don't own the fuckers we bailed out ;)
1279743443: <fbx> the summer wind, came blowin' in...from across the sea....
1279743444: <canadachan> here's an idea - make that $695 annual fine what it costs to join medicare
1279743471: <canadachan> i'd buy that for 695
1279743492: <fbx> well, you could also allow more folks to participate in the government's plan, which i hear is pretty good

1279746248: <acr0nym> Oh, no, I got the thing super cheap when Circuit Shitty was collapsing, so I went ahead and paid a hundred bucks for "lifetime" updates.

1279808395: <acr0nym> But, I see the logic.
1279808413: <acr0nym> It's a really tacky elastic on both sides of the straps, which provides grip on both sides of an object.
1279808431: <acr0nym> tacky/grippy
1279808432: <]3d0g> seemed like a good way to manage a relatively open back like a courier or backpacl

1279809099: <]3d0g> so calls still ring @ phone?

1279809231: <acr0nym> I possibly should have bought this one: http://www.crutchfield.com/s_113KDCX794/Kenwood-Excelon-KDC-X794.html?search=kenwood+excelon&ssi=0
1279809238: <acr0nym> I suspect the interface would be much better.
1279809247: <acr0nym> But, I wanted the USB and AUX right on the front of the radio.
1279809261: <acr0nym> The Excelon has it in the back.  Gonna run cables someplace else.
1279809396: <acr0nym> You're going for Wings today?
1279809451: <acr0nym> Hello, Johan, by the way....  Heh.
1279809734: <acr0nym> Hey, Geist, wanna loan me a car?  I wanna do the Cannonball Run....  ;)
1279809780: <fbx> heh
1279809802: <acr0nym> (For everyone who doesn't know, Johan is a Lotus "enthusiast"...)
1279809820: <]3d0g> yeah, wingday.
1279809824: <]3d0g> you in:
1279809825: <]3d0g> ?
1279809826: <fbx> is this where i say "lotus' suck" just to get his attention? ;)
1279809829: <acr0nym> What time?
1279809861: <]3d0g> usually 12-1230ish
1279809872: <acr0nym> Mebbe.  I'll give you a call a bit later.
1279809878: <]3d0g> coo
1279809884: <]3d0g> did you call me yesterday?
1279809890: <acr0nym> Yeah, was testing the radio BT.
1279809891: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279809898: <]3d0g> ah. I was on the bike
1279809908: <acr0nym> Weird, I thought I was calling your office.
1279809912: <acr0nym> Got it forwarding?
1279809925: <acr0nym> Oh, who knows, I was driving....
1279809926: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279809926: <]3d0g> the avaya system allows us to tie cells to our extensions
1279809929: <acr0nym> Right.
1279809951: <acr0nym> I figgered you'd left.
1279809951: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279809973: <fbx> bah...any decent phone system will allow simul-ring for desks and cells
1279809979: <fbx> ours does
1279809987: <]3d0g> I'm gonna be looking closely ad BT helmets this weekend.
1279809988: <acr0nym> Yeah, ours might.
1279809994: <acr0nym> But, I'll never turn it on.  Heh.
1279810014: <]3d0g> yeah, it's handy fbx
1279810017: <fbx> hrm...i think our proxy is fucking up my facebooking
1279810029: <acr0nym> I'm about ready to change my outgoing VM to say "don't leave a message.  e-mail me.  I can read SO much faster than you can talk"
1279810048: <acr0nym> And, of course, stop answering my desk phone.
1279810089: <]3d0g> heh
1279810224: <canadachan> the only reason anyone EVER called instead of emailed me at comcast was when they were trying to do something illicit and didn't want to leave a paper trail
1279810231: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279810242: <acr0nym> canadachan: Did you see my comment about wireless tethering?
1279810255: <canadachan> yes
1279810259: <acr0nym> Okey dokey.
1279810280: <canadachan> i never tried it before last night.  i'm at a hotel that only lets you register one mac address to the wireless
1279810294: <canadachan> so i figured what the hell... i'd give the phone a chance to sync
1279810310: <canadachan> was able to tether the laptop too
1279810506: <canadachan> blah.  i was hoping the prices would have dropped like a rock on the n1s since google announced the end of the program
1279810580: <]3d0g> me too
1279810613: <]3d0g> there's basically NO "clean" android phones now
1279810630: <canadachan> and the cliq soured me on anything motorola
1279810644: <fbx> clean?
1279810647: <fbx> meaning?
1279810659: <acr0nym> canadachan: You mean "Nokia/Siemens/Motorola"
1279810670: <]3d0g> the carriers are all doing skins on top of android that fuck it up.
1279810678: <fbx> ugh
1279810683: <]3d0g> N1 was the last clean phone
1279810685: <fbx> didn't know that
1279810701: <fbx> i've seen some decent reviews for droid phones lately, though
1279810705: <canadachan> and they're making relations with rom developers adversarial
1279810725: <]3d0g> yup bootloaders are getting hostile
1279810735: <canadachan> if you're happy with motorola stranding a perfectly good phone at android 1.5, then by all means buy a moto
1279810745: <canadachan> the hardware is good, but you're trapped
1279810758: <canadachan> completely 100% dependant on the carrier or manufacturer for updates
1279810760: <]3d0g> I really had hopes for the Dell Streak, but it went to ATT. I ain't doing ATT.
1279810781: <canadachan> at&t was phenominal everywhere but nyc and sanfransico 
1279810796: <]3d0g> and my house :-)
1279810804: <canadachan> i carried the winmo tilt for so long because it tethered like an absolute champ
1279810825: <]3d0g> tethering works great on my g1.
1279810861: <canadachan> tmobile doesn't have nearly the coverage footprint at&t does
1279810868: <canadachan> which has already bit me a few times in my travels
1279810877: <]3d0g> I've had zero complaints
1279810895: <canadachan> southern vermont is at&t and verizon only and they only just got those two carriers in the last 2 years
1279810903: <canadachan> prior to that was nada
1279810916: <canadachan> oh pardon, they did have a legacy rural analog carrier
1279810961: <-- Geist has quit (Ping timeout)
1279810966: <]3d0g> ATT has shit coverage in our building here. People are always asking me what I can do about it. I give them the address of the nearest TMO store.
1279810984: <fbx> hehe
1279811002: <canadachan> but but but i can't use my iiiiiphone *whine*
1279811047: <fbx> so, what you're all saying is you need a 3 band phone? where have i heard this before....oh yeah!
1279811096: <]3d0g> what's the point unless you've got contracts with multiple carriers?
1279811173: <canadachan> what?  you're not drug dealer elite with a plastic baggie of prepaid sims in your pocket?
1279811217: <]3d0g> no, but I found one on the street one time. plugged it into a phone and listened to some teenage girl's voicemail.
1279811225: <acr0nym> Hah! Nice.
1279811246: <]3d0g> I then took pity and destroyed it.
1279811280: <acr0nym> That's nice of ya.
1279811350: <canadachan> the voicemail or the sim?
1279811371: <]3d0g> sim
1279811382: <canadachan> merciful indeed
1279811392: <fbx> so sims have a standard interface, right?
1279811399: <canadachan> more or less
1279811408: <]3d0g> yup
1279811412: <canadachan> except for the iphone, no?
1279811421: <canadachan> they use a micro sim?
1279811424: <]3d0g> no, it's standard too - just micro
1279811429: <canadachan> ahh
1279811433: <]3d0g> a reg sim can be cut to fit micro
1279811444: <fbx> ok, so google do this: create a phone that accepts sims from the major providers and let them wrestle over selling sims and contracts attached to those sims. can you do that?
1279811465: <]3d0g> you've just described europe.
1279811471: <fbx> indeed i have
1279811477: <fbx> thanks for noticing!
1279811478: <fbx> ;)
1279811509: <fbx> and we live in an increasingly socialist nation? horse-fucking-shit
1279811514: <fbx> i just proved we don't
1279811516: <]3d0g> we're where we are thanks to the "free" market, plus being first.
1279811522: <fbx> yep
1279811542: <fbx> if this is what being first gets you, i'll take being second and better, thanks
1279811619: <canadachan> it's pretty interesting when you can get pictures of the china oil spill easier than the US one
1279812053: <canadachan> finally slogged through anathem
1279812090: <canadachan> it's like umberto eco got bored and let tom clancy finish the last few chapters
1279812114: <]3d0g> slogged as in you don't recommend?
1279812296: <canadachan> it was enjoyable in an overly tedious way until the end when you're not rewarded with a spectacular ending
1279812360: <canadachan> kinda like shogun where the whole book was leadup to this epic battle and then it ends saying "and so it came to pass that torranaga became shogun of japan"
1279812420: <canadachan> anathem actually had the final battle but it was hokey action adventure compared to the (if overly) lush rest o the book
1279812509: <]3d0g> I just bought my 1st Stephenson EPUB - Snowcrash. Haven't started it yet.
1279812534: <canadachan> snow crash was pretty damn good
1279812541: <canadachan> the diamond age was fucking incredible
1279812545: <canadachan> one of my favorite books
1279812560: <canadachan> cryptonomicon made me want a refund
1279813626: <]3d0g> heh
1279813627: <]3d0g> noted
1279813660: <]3d0g> Finishing Suarez' Daemon right now. Excellent read.
1279813694: <]3d0g> Oh, I got Paolo Bacigalupi's The Windup Girl too. Looking forward to that one.
1279813746: <]3d0g> I'm now damn glad I didn't buy a kindle or nook. I'm already buying too many ebooks w/o the instant connectivity :)
1279813756: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279813776: <acr0nym> Yeah, the "instant gratification" factor is OUTRAGEOUS.
1279813789: <acr0nym> "Hey, I wanna read that!"  <30 seconds> "Hey, I'm reading it!"
1279813852: <telecon> Interesting.  Cryptonomicon is one of my favorites by him.
1279813871: <acr0nym> canadachan: Do you read William Gibson?
1279813877: <]3d0g> kobo ain't much better. always enticing me with sales and coupons. I buy a book, and the next time I plug it in, bang, everything syncs.
1279813892: <acr0nym> And, if so, have you read the latest two?  Pattern Recognition, and Spook Country?
1279813907: <]3d0g> I haven't read Spook yet.
1279813918: <telecon> Pattern Country and Spook Recognition?
1279813930: <telecon> Perhaps I should reread them.
1279813962: <]3d0g> Gibson's writing is somehow incompatible with my brain.
1279813978: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279813991: <telecon> I really like his early stuff.
1279814018: <]3d0g> I *like* his stuff. There's just something about his sentence structure that makes it hard for me to read.
1279814025: <acr0nym> Wow, being able to plug in a 32GB flash drive to my car stereo is really gonna distract me.
1279814029: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279814063: <telecon> :)
1279814072: <]3d0g> I may swipe the Sony headend from Sally's truck. She never uses it anymore and it's got USB.
1279814112: <acr0nym> Think about it.....  If I assume ~1MB/minute for mp3 music, that's 3 weeks of continuous music....
1279814190: <telecon> Try and plan it well.
1279814194: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279814204: <acr0nym> Actually, it's got about 10GB of This American Life on it...
1279814208: <acr0nym> And music.
1279814208: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279814318: <telecon> 10 gig of TAL should keep you busy for a while.
1279814333: <telecon> That's probably less than 1MB/Min too
1279814338: <acr0nym> Yeah, prolly so.
1279814472: <telecon> 64 kbit/s, 44100 Hz mono
1279815035: <acr0nym> Heh, just for Music, I currently have 3.06 GB/509 files, 28 folders.
1279815062: <acr0nym> Oh, overall NPR podcasts- 20.9GB, 755 files, 9 folders.
1279815255: <telecon> What other npr podcasts?
1279815261: <acr0nym> Radiolab and Fresh Air
1279815303: <acr0nym> Although, TAL is actually 12.1 GB
1279815327: <telecon> Freshair and Radiolab can be so hit or miss.
1279815506: <telecon> Any other recommended podcasts?
1279815511: <acr0nym> In general?
1279815512: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279815515: <telecon> Yeah
1279815517: <telecon> Besides EL.
1279815526: <acr0nym> Not really, actually.  Have you tried Distorted View?  Heh.
1279815530: <telecon> no
1279815539: <acr0nym> Umm.  It's also hit and miss.
1279815541: <acr0nym> :)
1279815563: <telecon> hm
1279815564: <telecon> k
1279815712: <acr0nym> heh, ]3d0g is a big fan.
1279816261: <canadachan> i do read gibson, yes
1279816289: <acr0nym> Did you like the last two?
1279816336: <canadachan> pattern rec and spook ?
1279816341: <acr0nym> Jah.
1279816342: <canadachan> or are there more?
1279816348: <acr0nym> No, just those two, for now.
1279816350: <canadachan> i've read them both, and don't recall either
1279816361: <canadachan> in other words, they failed to make much of an impression
1279816370: <acr0nym> Cayce Pollard, Curtas, looking for the creator of the footage....
1279816377: <canadachan> ah that was ok
1279816381: <acr0nym> For Hubertus Bigend, Blue Ant.
1279816387: <canadachan> nothing really earth shattering
1279816405: <acr0nym> Hrmm.  I have some sense that, among my friends, I was the only person to really like both of them, a lot.
1279816421: <canadachan> which one was that?
1279816428: <canadachan> and then what was the other one?
1279816430: <acr0nym> Both, really.....
1279816435: <canadachan> both?
1279816448: <acr0nym> Yeah, both were based on Hubertus Bigend looking for strange things.
1279816454: <canadachan> maybe that's why they blended into a wibblywobbly mass
1279816461: <acr0nym> Yeah, that's what telecon says....
1279816462: <acr0nym> Heh.
1279816486: <acr0nym> I think it's gonna be like the "All Tomorrow's Parties" trilogy.  The big pay-off is the last book.
1279816523: <canadachan> i'm reading some tom clancy knockoff now
1279816529: <canadachan> guy was former cia
1279816552: <canadachan> barry eisler
1279816565: <canadachan> needed a mental break after anathem
1279816634: <canadachan> though after that i'm starting on this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeelee_Sequence
1279816649: <canadachan> have Vacuum Diagrams queued up
1279816830: <telecon> I still haven't finished Anathem.
1279816838: <telecon> Own it in 3 formats, too.
1279816842: <canadachan> sucker
1279816847: <telecon> Yep
1279816989: <canadachan> i bought it pre-order on the kindle and JUST finished it last night
1279817194: <canadachan> roaming charge potential gives me a lot of time to catch up on reading
1279818000: --> Geist (root@dp-27EE8524.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) has joined #lobby
1279818373: <acr0nym> Damn you, ]3d0g, why do I even OWN "Aqua" or "Vengaboys"?
1279818381: <acr0nym> Well, not "own", per se....
1279818382: <acr0nym> heh.
1279818390: <canadachan> oO
1279818645: <]3d0g> because they're full of awesome?
1279818661: <acr0nym> I'm gonna use a language you understand....  "weaksauce"
1279818671: <]3d0g> SAGE
1279818681: <fbx> here we go....
1279818681: <canadachan> rosemary and thyme
1279818758: <fbx> he means saah-gay, even though he's not technically wapanese
1279818851: <acr0nym> I'm discovering songs that I'd be perfectly happy to NEVER hear again.  "The Rockafeller Skank", "Born Slippy".
1279818855: <acr0nym> i.e.
1279818930: <]3d0g> DESU!
1279818937: <acr0nym> Eww.
1279819015: <fbx> one can never have too much DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU
1279819019: <fbx> :)
1279819023: <canadachan> the pillows sountrack for FLCL is awesome though
1279819029: * fbx hears the boot coming
1279819066: <fbx> desu still means nothing, right?
1279819078: <acr0nym> Yeah, I got "desu" and "pantsu" mixed up, just then.
1279819125: <canadachan> desu is a word.  the u is silent.  it's how you can tell an anime freak from someone that actually knows a modicum of japanese
1279819173: <fbx> is it really a word that has meaning, or just a way for anime toons to finish sentences because they're too cute to...well, just finish the sentence?
1279819203: * fbx remembers the #distributed corollary was DB yelling "NO PANTS" in ~
1279819205: <canadachan> so desu ne is kinda like saying uh huh while you're listening to some one.  i think literally it means this is true
1279819210: <]3d0g> I can't remember did we already discuss the latest 4chan hilarity w/ that 11 y/o?
1279819225: <fbx> another 11 yo?
1279819225: <acr0nym> ]3d0g: You and I have, very slightly.
1279819229: <fbx> wow
1279819231: <fbx> do tell
1279819245: <]3d0g> http://gawker.com/5589103/how-the-internet-beat-up-an-11+year+old-girl
1279819263: <]3d0g> http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Jessi_Slaughter
1279819288: <acr0nym> Rocketboom covers it better: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/jessi-slaughter-you-dun-goofd-the-consquences-will-never-be-the-same
1279819346: <ouiji> I find this really amusing.. I went to dinner with my parents the other night, and half the night they were telling me about all their financial woes.. and I just found out that my dad just got himself a new car.. he is going to pick it up right now ->  http://www.johnrobertsmotorworks.com/VehicleDetails/636976783
1279819375: <]3d0g> My wife continually falls for that shit from her parents.
1279819381: <acr0nym> Well, that's why he's got money woes!
1279819384: <]3d0g> fuckers are on the new car of the month club
1279819553: <canadachan> lease?
1279819567: <canadachan> pay for the depreciation and then not own the car in the end plan?
1279819600: <]3d0g> old people don't lease
1279819874: <canadachan> i'm kinda hoping for a bit of deflation.  imma go buy a used TT for cash
1279819879: <ouiji> don't think it was a lease
1279819892: <fbx> summerfag obsession, desu
1279819916: <ouiji> he know's the owner of the dealership, so I'm pretty sure he got it 7% over wholesale
1279819944: <ouiji> or dealer cost, or whatever ya want to call it
1279819995: <fbx> dealers pay 7% over wholesale?
1279820003: <fbx> i thought it was less than that
1279820182: <]3d0g> just skimmed the jessi updates on ED. I'm shocked how well this has kept /b/s attention. I guess Anon was sorely overdue for a new victim. 
1279820276: <fbx> hrm...seems installing https everywhere has temporarily solved my FB blank page issue
1279820353: <fbx> something about bypassing the proxy's cache, most likely
1279820355: <fbx> stupid proxy
1279820509: <ouiji> he doesn't usually get em at the true dealer cost, and I don't know if it applies on this car, since it is the only one they have
1279820517: <ouiji> but I really have no idea
1279820746: <canadachan> i do like the new mustangs though
1279820790: <acr0nym> Yeah, I like the look of 'em, too.

1280238279: <fbx> is there an rsync-like bit level sync prog you would recommend for the windows side of the house? key phrase being "that you would recommend". it would also help if it didn't cost a bundle.
1280238317: <fbx> and i'd rather not run cygwin or a daemon on this user's machine if possible
1280238328: <fbx> so this would be a win32 port if possible
1280238446: <fbx> and since the destination is an enterprise server holding user dirs, i'm loathe to do anything other than treat it as a dumb destination, with no client/server type interaction if possible

1280242370: <fbx> dp: looking at it now...interesting
1280245457: <fbx> Unison is no longer under active development as a research project. (Our research efforts are now focused on a follow-on project called Harmony, described at http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/harmony.) At this point, there is no one whose job it is to maintain Unison, fix bugs, or answer questions.
1280245470: <portlandchan> har har
1280245484: <fbx> However, the original developers are all still using Unison daily. It will continue to be maintained and supported for the foreseeable future, and we will occasionally release new versions with bug fixes, small improvements, and contributed patches.
1280245503: <portlandchan> supported usually means answering questions
1280245527: <fbx> odd set of back-to-back statements
1280245596: <portlandchan> sounds like a "don't lose confidence and abandon the project while you wait for vaporware but don't fucking bug us if the shit don't work"

1280247988: <]3d0g> which tmo does 20 payments, no interest so that's fine

1280528984: <tinfoil> :-p
1280528995: <tinfoil> Longer exposure, motion blur, etc
1280529578: <tinfoil> One of the photographers I hang out with is great, but the problem is ALL of his photos look the same
1280529584: <tinfoil> they are perfect
1280529622: <tinfoil> I emulated his style for a while and realized I didn't want to have my photos look so perfect
1280529630: <tinfoil> or like a fashion shoot

1280781965: <telegone> That should be fun.
1280781981: <Geist> it was good 
1280782143: <Geist> Rio would be much better Than the Riv
1280783015: <dp> Rio's just further out
1280783043: <Geist> not really and they have free shuttles to Bally's and back
1280783163: <tinfoil> hey
1280783191: <tinfoil> Rio, eh?
1280783241: <dp> Rio's not right on the strip, is it?
1280783263: <tinfoil> No, it's off
1280783277: <tinfoil> Just far enough to be inconvenient
1280783395: <tinfoil> It makes needed a rental or cab that much more important
1280783443: <tinfoil> That being said, Unlike alexis park or Riv, it's a nice hotel
1280783465: <Geist> yes and the Riv is too small for Con too
1280783469: <dp> right.  that's what I was suggesting; "further out"
1280783529: <Geist> Maybe I should submit a presentation for Con 19 too
1280783903: <tinfoil> Did you submit for this year?
1280783916: <Geist> Nah, I was too lazy
1280783965: <tinfoil> Typical story :-)
1280783967: <Geist> However, I am getting inspired with my EMP project, which would be interesting to show how to blow things up
1280783982: <tinfoil> EMP?  Now what have you done?
1280783990: <Geist> EMP gun
1280783999: <tinfoil> HFRF or EMP?
1280784006: <Geist> HERF
1280784016: <tinfoil> big difference.  :-0
1280784018: <tinfoil> :-)
1280784028: <Geist> same technology
1280784040: <Geist> been plain with a Marx Generator
1280784058: <Geist> Which can disable a PC 100 ft away
1280784082: <Geist> or a cop car if you are chased by one
1280784086: <Geist> lol
1280784131: <tinfoil> hah
1280784394: <tinfoil> I'm working on an audio/video art project for next year
1280784402: <tinfoil> Have you seen the opencv library?
1280784421: <tinfoil> I'm going to start playing with it for face/expression detection
1280784446: <Geist> havent
1280785026: <tinfoil> More reading on official high altitude EMP tests - scary and interesting:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_Prime (US Tests)  and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_K_Project (USSR tests)
1280785051: <tinfoil> Even now, most detailed information on EMP is heavily classified - that I didn't know
1280785343: <tinfoil> What's interesting is that the earth's magnetic field has a significant effect on it.  The USSR tests were held over ground, where the magnetic field was less.  Even though the devices used were smaller than the US devices they created a much stronger EMP.
1280785502: <Geist> You don't need a massive sized device anymore. A destructive enough device can be constructed using readily available parts
1280785599: <Geist> or check this sinister device out http://www.ettus.com/products
1280785626: <Geist> this can capture or broadcast any frequency
1280785661: <Geist> at many frequencies simultaneously
1280785716: <Geist> so like GSM sniffing, keyboard sniffing, car alarm disabling, garage door opening etc etc etc
1280785752: <tinfoil> Hey, isn't that stuff illegal?  :-)
1280785779: <Geist> device is not, but what you do with it is another story
1280786856: <hoamchan> i really really REALLY want a cell phone jammer for use at airport club lounges
1280786881: <hoamchan> last time i was in kewr, some guy was literally screaming all the way to new zealand 
1280790719: <tinfoil> "Need root ssh keys created and deployed to remotely run root scripts"
1280790727: <tinfoil> That is a ticket assigned to me.

1280791493: <tinfoil> Wrote a more constructive reply - Give me a list of scripts you want to be run as root.  I'll allow passwordless sudo access to those scripts, but under the condition that I monitor them with Tripwire and any changes to them need to be filed with Change Control else it will be considered a security incident"

1280847994: <dp> alright networking gods, school me
1280848002: <]3d0g> D+
1280848004: <dp> we've got two boxes hooked up to an unmanaged switch
1280848010: <dp> both have public IPs
1280848028: <dp> both are *only* connected to said switch
1280848043: <dp> transferring data from one box to the other should go through what basic path?
1280848050: <dp> A -> Switch -> B?
1280848058: <dp> A -> Switch -> Core network -> Switch -> B
1280848128: <]3d0g> what kind of data?
1280848133: <Geist> if not layer 3 it only depends on how the workstations are set up
1280848150: <dp> ]3d0g: tcp
1280848157: <dp> rsync, for the technical
1280848198: <]3d0g> if masks are set correctly, A -> switch -> B because the TCP stack should realize it's all L2.
1280848222: <dp> masks where, on each box?
1280848226: <]3d0g> yes
1280848236: <dp> hrm
1280848246: <dp> and how do I determine if the masks are set correctly?
1280848249: <]3d0g> masks determine what's local and what to pitch to routing table.
1280848285: <]3d0g> are they the same?
1280848296: <dp> are what the same?
1280848301: <]3d0g> masks on the boxes
1280848339: <dp> Mask:255.255.255.240 on both boxes
1280848384: <]3d0g> then traffic *should* be direct between them. not happening?
1280848384: <dp> hrm
1280848386: <dp> wait
1280848396: <]3d0g> firewall(s) on?
1280848398: <dp> if I look at the routing table, I see the following
1280848429: <dp> http://pastebin.dp.cx/pastebin.php?show=233593
1280848448: <dp> that implies that devices on the .240 mask are going out to the core network, right?

1280859438: <]3d0g> edit /etc/sysconfig/iptables
1280859456: <dp> I thought there was some ncurses based app that would do it
1280859460: <]3d0g> or run system-config-securitylevel if it's installed
1280859517: <]3d0g> can't do any pre or post routing there though
1280859522: <dp> hrm
1280860335: <tinfoil> Either edit /etc/sysconfig/iptables OR run system-config-securitylevel, but whatever you do don't do both.  Also, make sure you document which you used so someone doesn't accidently use the other method and eliminate your work
1280860427: <tinfoil> Not that I've run across that issue
1280860455: <tinfoil> The part that annoyed me is the admin that didn't document which he used here used each method randomly
1280860479: <tinfoil> On like 30 severs
1280860493: <tinfoil> Thankfully they let him go
1280860495: <tinfoil> but the damage is done
1280860633: <]3d0g> but system-config-securitylevel is just an editor for iptables.

1280860685: <tinfoil> hense, use one or the other, but not both

1280871283: <tinfoil> Let alone developers
1280871325: <tinfoil> A developer wants his application opened through the firewall so people can access it, but can't tell us the IP's or ports involved
1280871354: <tinfoil> Oh, correction, he just told us the port, but wants any->any:5100 opened

1281020064: <dp> tx
1281020144: <]3d0g> tho I believe your premise applies to nearly *all* degrees.

1281020208: <dp> would love comments, if you're willing ;)
1281021576: <fbx> how is it a DR exercise if you're naming the time of disaster, not processing a bank's end-of-day (even though your 12 hour window WOULD go through an EOD, and that processing is required by the Fed), and you're asked to take screen shots as data validation?
1281021581: <fbx> jebus
1281021594: <fbx> this is "see? we rsync your data to our DR site!"
1281021595: <fbx> no DR
1281021598: <fbx> not* DR
1281021711: <]3d0g> not sure I follow. DR exercises should define the timing as the response would likely vary from 12am to 12pm.
1281023174: <fbx> this is really a cutover and recovery exercise. our vendor is acting as if it's a full DR/BCP exercise.
1281023214: <fbx> the problem lies in the 12 hour window, and the variability in our "data verification window"
1281023259: <fbx> some folks will be fine within that 12 hours and not NEED to perform an EOD in between disaster and recovery
1281023304: <fbx> some won't, and should (according to rule) have to perform an EOD (which is a lot more than screenshots verifying data)

1281025779: <hoamchan> no

1281030961: <tinfoil> Ugh, so the group that had a "dev" server in production last fall has more servers we didn't know about in production
1281030976: <tinfoil> of course, same type - poorly maintained dev boxes
1281030984: <tinfoil> no redundancy, no backup
1281030995: <tinfoil> and guess how we found out... again?
1281031001: <tinfoil> That's right, security incident
1281031084: <tinfoil> So, I email the owners saying - We found out servers X, Y, and Z are being attacked from the internet.  Since we're 3 weeks away from complete cutover to the new datacenters (shutting down the datacenter you're in), I'm assuming that we can push your migration through faster and turn off these servers.
1281031089: <tinfoil> The response?
1281031090: <tinfoil> "What cutover?"
1281031111: <tinfoil> They didn't even know they were being moved

1281031291: <tinfoil> "Uh, we're not sure"
1281031326: <tinfoil> So, you have a business critical server publicly facing the internet, actively being attacked from china, and you don't know who is using it?
1281031337: <tinfoil> Business critical my ass
1281032465: <hoamchan> what's business critical mean?
1281033021: <ouiji1> it means the chineez will take over if it doesn't happen correctly

1281378791: <tinfoil> I thought they all died from overdose
1281378849: <tinfoil> Also, I thought the DEA scheduled it a few years ago.  :-)
1281379773: <tinfoil> Hah, I went to read up on DEA scheduling and was linked to a study funded by the UK government regarding the classification of illegal drugs (plus tobacco and alcohol) - In the study they reclassified the drugs based upon scientific analysis of physical, mental, and social harm the drugs actually caused.
1281379838: <tinfoil> Stuff like heroin, cocain, and meth were all at the time, along with alcohol and tobacco.  Near the bottom of the list was MDMA (extacy) and  LSD
1281379940: <tinfoil> Psilocybin (magic mushrooms) weren't even on the list - and the report STRONGLY criticised how it was considered a class A drug by the law - with Crack, coke, meth, etc - when they could find only one mortality in over a decade related to it.
1281381240: <tinfoil> I find it interesting how cannibis falls in the middle of the chart, but still significantly below alcohol and tobacco

1281385401: <tinfoil> LSD was fun for the first few hours
1281385415: <tinfoil> after that it was more like "Yeah, am I done yet?"
1281385445: <tinfoil> Happy I tried them, but can't see why people would use them more than once
1281385466: <tinfoil> Unless their lives were so bad that they drugs are an improvement
1281385895: <fbx> shrooms are a shorter version of LSD, and probably better for you, if reasoning holds
1281385922: <tinfoil> I kinda like them, actually
1281385923: <fbx> i've tried many, and it seems only the most natural of things are worth it
1281385950: <fbx> pot, shrooms...beer i suppose
1281385962: <fbx> liquor can make me an ass if i'm not careful
1281385968: <fbx> and the more i drink, the less careful i am
1281385971: <fbx> so beer
1281386017: <tinfoil> I try to drink no more than 1-2 drinks a sitting
1281386024: <tinfoil> even 1 can be too much sometimes
1281386045: <tinfoil> :-
1281386046: <tinfoil> :-)
1281386088: <tinfoil> I was at a party recently where people were mixing alcohol, coke, and mdma in significant qualities
1281386097: <tinfoil> That was fairly disturbing
1281386110: <tinfoil> I have to admit feeling very uncomfortable
1281386112: <tinfoil> and wanting to leave
1281386253: <tinfoil> Won't be accepting any invites from them again

1281473953: <tinfoil> "How does it determine if an alert is critical?"

1281473983: <tinfoil> "
1281473990: <tinfoil> "Uh, it doesn't."
1281474018: <tinfoil> "So, how does it alert us when unauthorized changes occur?"
1281474051: <tinfoil> "A) It doesn't send us alerts.  B) It doesn't determine if a change is authorized or unauthorized."

1281474549: <tinfoil> "The best way to think of tripwire is like a motion-sensitive camera.  It does not understand what it sees, and does not set off alarms - it only records when it registers motion.  The recording can then subject to interpretation by a security guard or investigator."

1281539820: <milkchan> pandora gets really repetitive really quickly
1281539838: <milkchan> which is why they don't let you skips songs.  the BS about their license is exactly that
1281539897: <dp> ?
1281539944: <milkchan> the faster you skip, the faster you start noticing selection exhaustion.  they blame the riaa for it but it's really a dodge

1281620989: <dp> was just curious
1281621435: <telecon> Yeah, I have a sound card that supposedly only supports hdmi audio out.

1281627868: <acr0nym> ]3d0g!  How much do you know about PWM and controlling an RGB LED through an AVR embedded controller?  :)
1281627930: <]3d0g> doing some sort of motor control?
1281627960: <acr0nym> Heh, no, playing with the 303 badge....  ;)
1281627969: <acr0nym> Hey, you still need one, don't you?
1281627971: <]3d0g> why PWM then?
1281627988: <acr0nym> It appears to control the intensity/brightness of the LED.
1281627990: <]3d0g> you said you were holding one for me
1281627998: <acr0nym> Yeah, just keeping track.
1281627998: <acr0nym> Heh.
1281628022: <acr0nym> Have you looked at the badge stuff at all? http://www.senkohanabi.com/badge/
1281628035: <]3d0g> ah, not technically PWM.
1281628048: <]3d0g> Yeah, I bookmarked that.
1281628075: <acr0nym> I starteded playing with the code, got a cylon mode I really like, now I want to improve how the RGB LED acts.
1281628108: <acr0nym> Heh, started.
1281628109: <acr0nym> Weird.
1281628295: <]3d0g> at a glance I'd say PD1 is on/off, PB2 - PB4 control each color.

Larry LaPrise, the man who wrote "The Hokey Pokey", died peacefully at age 93.   The most traumatic part for his family was getting him into the coffin.  They put his left leg in.

1281974509: <tinfoil> Without even having a preference on WHICH javascript gui libraries they used, they would be so much better off if they migrated their projects to one of the plethora of open source libraries that allow distribution of their code
1281974545: <tinfoil> ie - I don't care what library they choose - the open source solutions are much better than their propriatary in-house crap

1281988441: <tinfoil> So, today along we're going to have 100 incidents

1281988813: <acr0nym> Heh.  Fun!

1281997993: <tinfoil> one enters, one leaves
1281997999: <tinfoil> we have achieved balance
1281998027: <tinfoil> So, tripwire reports aren't good enough for my VP
1281998057: <tinfoil> So I have to write a program to parse triwire xml output so I can parse it into something my VP likes
1281998107: <tinfoil> He doesn't every want anything in the colors red or green in a report unless it's an emergency or something good. (respectively)
1281998205: <milkchan> eh?
1281998229: <milkchan> go to severity manager in settings and change all the colors to not red and not green
1281998232: <milkchan> done
1281998464: <tinfoil> No
1281998477: <tinfoil> What color does a "modification" show up as in a report?
1281998480: <tinfoil> red
1281998490: <tinfoil> Red = bad
1281998520: <tinfoil> If he see's red he expects an incident to be associated with the change report
1281998544: <tinfoil> He's trying to normalize all reports from all applications across IT
1281998630: <tinfoil> Additions are green, so they must be good.
1281998660: <tinfoil> So if it's green he expects us to be bragging about a "win" for the team
1281998696: <tinfoil> And yes, he wants to see some of the detailed reports
1281998719: <tinfoil> so I have to give him detailed reports where the changes aren't color coded unless there's a reason for it
1281998729: <tinfoil> It's political bullshit
1281999499: <tinfoil> One of the other changes he wants is for the common names for LDAP elements to be easier to read
1281999515: <tinfoil> Since he wants the details of all changes that occur to executive accounts
1282001225: <milkchan> you can export xml and import into excel.  also, this works on some browser/spreadsheet combinations.  you can mouseclick+drag to highlight the results from a report or elements view and paste it (paste special -> text only) into excel.  depending on the versions, it will actually auto format into columns which is really helpful
1282002379: <tinfoil> Oh, THAT I didn't know
1282002420: <tinfoil> Of course, I'm writing a script to parse the XML and convert it to a VP friendly report so it can auto-email him nightly.
1282002433: <tinfoil> Wonder if excel will do that
1282002447: <tinfoil> It's a point solution to make a single person happy (and look good)

1282078725: <tinfoil> Seriously, that is pretty damn cool
1282078749: <tinfoil> I know people involved with the antarctica program often look into something called a "world pass" if that still exists
1282078775: <tinfoil> it's something like military "space available" as long as you don't back track or overlap your travel IIRC
1282078805: <tinfoil> http://www.airtimetable.com/airpass.htm
1282078956: <]3d0g> Reminds me of WestPac. Fucking loved those guys. Every spring they had a voucher sale. Basically coupons you could fly on at any time. Just show up at the airport and go.
1282079126: <Geist> yea westpac was best airline ever until they moved to denver
1282079146: <]3d0g> yup, the beginning of their demise. 
1282079272: <tinfoil> Oooooo, multiple sonic booms
1282079309: <tinfoil> No details yet, but FAA confirms
1282079314: <tinfoil> Geist: Hear them?
1282079326: <milkchan> inserting extra sylables into Hadouken does not make the attack anymore devestating you know

1282079344: <telecon> Hm
1282079346: <telecon> odd
1282079417: <]3d0g> Sorry, Goose, but it's time to buzz a tower. 
1282079795: <tinfoil> Friend of mine are reporting the boom from Tacoma to Bremerton
1282079808: <tinfoil> and I heard it here in Kirkland
1282079813: <tinfoil> that's a big triangle
1282079862: <tinfoil> Considering the geography and foliage, that's pretty impressive, and shows their likely altitude
1282079997: <]3d0g> I got whacked by one when I was a kid, hunting in northern MI. Pilot was maybe 2K off the ground. Nearly took me off my feet the shock was so hard.
1282080007: <tinfoil> Ahh, the no-fly zone was breached somewhere near west-seattle
1282080024: <tinfoil> Yeah, they are really impressive
1282080049: <tinfoil> They'd send a shockwave through the carrier I was on when they did a sonic flyby
1282080062: <tinfoil> (about 3 times while I was in service)
1282080154: <acr0nym> A'ight, I'm outta here, and headed your way, ]3d0g ....

1282319274: <acr0nym> Heh.  Even for people who DO know Agile....
1282319300: <acr0nym> Do you have a Nexus One now?
1282319303: <]3d0g> G1.
1282319308: <acr0nym> Couldn't remember.
1282319727: <]3d0g> I was sorely tempted by the dev Nexus One, but I just don't think I can give up a keyboard.
1282320040: <acr0nym> Yeah, I go back and forth pretty significantly.
1282320045: <acr0nym> I would definitely like a keyboard.
1282320061: <acr0nym> But, then again, if it'd support one of the small bluetooth keyboards, that'd prolly be enough for me.  I don't need it SUPER often.
1282320095: <telecon> swype
1282320141: <]3d0g> wasn't blown away by swype. Better than stock, but still a far cry from a proper keyboard.
1282320185: <]3d0g> The Epic is just about the perfect phone, but I don't know about switching to Sprint.
1282320962: <telecon> ]3d0g: The G2 is just about to drop.
1282321030: <telecon> http://www.tmonews.com/2010/08/t-mobile-g2-to-release-on-september-29th/
1282321041: <telecon> I'm very tempted by that phone.
1282321053: <]3d0g> that's what we were just talking about
1282321054: <telecon> But, I think the mytouch hd might be worth the wait, too.
1282321069: <]3d0g> I've got an Epic on reserve. Need to decide which...
1282321094: <telecon> Do you really want to switch to sprint?

1282321107: <]3d0g> m
1282321139: <telecon> I liked sprint when I had them.  I left for the g1.
1282321154: <]3d0g> TWC is also a Clearwire partner which means I get crazy discounts.
1282321160: <telecon> Ah
1282321184: <telecon> That might be worth it then.  I was very happy with sprint service, but got pissed off over lack of android.
1282322339: <dp> hrm.  I wonder if it's possible to install gentoo as a base, and then install debian over that, without using the typical debian installer

1282839542: <]3d0g> huh? you got a job lead?
1282839559: <acr0nym> Yes.  You've even seen the ad posted...  If you're reading 303, that is.
1282839581: <]3d0g> only one I saw was NOLA
1282839587: <acr0nym> No, older...
1282839598: <]3d0g> huh. wherebouts?
1282839604: <acr0nym> Bay Area.  Zynga.
1282839646: <]3d0g> Fucking expensive man. 
1282839651: <acr0nym> Yes....
1282839671: <]3d0g> I'd have to be Petaluma or even further north to even consider living in CA.
1282839681: <acr0nym> I'd be taking that into account in salary discussions...
1282839716: <acr0nym> Petaluma?  Hour north of SF?  Hrm.
1282839730: <]3d0g> Sure, WTH, not much tying you here anymore. Change is fun.
1282839746: <acr0nym> Heh, well, we'll see.
1282839893: <acr0nym> Strictly speaking, if I'm going to leave 303, I have more interest in Portland or Seattle.
1282840101: <]3d0g> I can't handle the rain.
1282840533: <acr0nym> I like rain.
1282840544: <acr0nym> Except, hrmm, not getting rained on.
1282841095: <telecon> The question about Petaluma is does bart run there.
1282841118: <acr0nym> Umm, no: http://www.bart.gov/stations/
1282841133: <]3d0g> There's no bart at all to the north that I know of
1282841192: <acr0nym> Might be able to drive to Richmond, then Park-n-Ride.
1282841233: <acr0nym> Who knows.  This kind of planning may be a little premature.  Heh.
1282841256: <telecon> It's important to the decision.
1282841272: <acr0nym> Sure, but, even the research is premature.  I've only had one conversation, with a recruiter.
1282841320: <acr0nym> Heh: http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs411.snc4/47373_1549590749290_1520737842_31420118_410250_n.jpg
1282841329: <telecon> lol
1282841750: <acr0nym> I wonder if anyone local sells hot sauce bottles.  I don't really need 12.  Heh.
1282841896: <telecon> Just a shaker bottle right?  Check Peppercorn
1282841910: <acr0nym> Yeah....  Umm.  Not gonna happen, for multiple reasons.
1282841921: <acr0nym> 1)  I hate Peppercorn.  2)  I hate being near the Pearl St. Mall.
1282841979: <acr0nym> Plus, most everything I'd want at Peppercorn is available at a third of the price at a restaurant supply store.
1282841997: <acr0nym> Oh, hrmm.  They might, actually, have them.
1282842004: <acr0nym> For restaurants making their own small batch items.
1282842771: <acr0nym> Hah!  I realize webrings are pretty much dead, but, this is still awesome: http://www.ringoffire.net/

1282842909: <acr0nym> And what?
1282842916: <telecon> Have you tried it?
1282842920: <acr0nym> No.  
1282842939: <acr0nym> I don't currently have a microphone plugged into my computer.
1282842943: <telecon> Ah
1282842956: <acr0nym> For that matter, I'm not even sure where that microphone is....  Hrm.
1282842982: <]3d0g> I don't see anything obviously different on my gmail
1282843003: <acr0nym> On the left-hand side, in the chat area....

1282854172: <telecon> You could mix them, but why fuck up the coffee?
1282854172: <PipSqueek> 
1282854188: <]3d0g> That's what Irish whiskey is for.
1282854188: <PipSqueek> 
1282854243: <]3d0g> this diet mountain dew I'm drinking just got exponentially more unappealing with this conversation.

1282854951: <PipSqueek> 
1282854986: <dp> pass.  I'd rather make it myself

1282857824: <PipSqueek> 
1282858239: <ouiji1> grrr. why cant I find a damn app in synaptic for ripping CD's into ISO's

1282858632: <PipSqueek> 
1282858683: <telecon> Or are you looking for something that will figure out the name of the cd automagically?
1282858683: <PipSqueek> 
1282858691: <]3d0g> was waiting for that :-P
1282858691: <PipSqueek> 
1282858740: <ouiji1> It's not for me :-p
1282858740: <PipSqueek> 
1282858758: <ouiji1> need something with a UI for another user
1282858758: <PipSqueek> 
1282858767: <telecon> Yeah, it's called bash.
1282858767: <PipSqueek> 
1282858777: <telecon> That's a ui
1282858777: <PipSqueek> 
1282858782: <ouiji1> they aren't quite there yet
1282858782: <PipSqueek> 
1282858809: <ouiji1> if it doesn't have pictures, they can't use it
1282858809: <PipSqueek>

1282920759: <PipSqueek> 
1282920864: <acr0nym> The real problem with that whole idea is HAVING TO WATCH THE TODAY SHOW.  Heh.
1282920864: <PipSqueek> 
1282920899: <]3d0g> indeed
1282920899: <PipSqueek>

1282921018: <PipSqueek> 
1282921033: <dp> and I forgot my headset again today... though I did get a chance to try out the calling from gmail thing
1282921033: <PipSqueek> 
1282921036: <]3d0g> Oh, I finally got the gmail update.

1282921202: <PipSqueek> 
1282921205: <]3d0g> fail
1282921205: <PipSqueek> 
1282921229: <acr0nym> Yeah, this mainboard is lame.  You can't have a line-in and a Mic at the same time.  Thus, I have a USB Fast Track microphone input.
1282921229: <PipSqueek> 
1282921249: <acr0nym> And, seemingly, goole voice grabbed the other one.
1282921249: <PipSqueek>

1282921384: <acr0nym> Hah!
1282921384: <PipSqueek> 
1282921432: <]3d0g> if 800x slowed down makes it listenable, 3x sped up could very well open up a vortex of suck, consuming the known universe.
1282921432: <PipSqueek> 
1282921441: <acr0nym> Or, at least, your head.

1283895400: <PipSqueek> 
1283895406: <acr0nym> Yep.
1283895406: <PipSqueek> 
1283895430: <]3d0g> we talkin' ass-raping hot or there some flavor here?
1283895430: <PipSqueek> 
1283895473: <]3d0g> I'm down for either, BTW ;)
1283895473: <PipSqueek> 
1283895495: <acr0nym> Actually, the first "hot" batch still has some good flavor.
1283895495: <PipSqueek> 
1283895504: <acr0nym> The second batch is still aging, so we'll see.  Heh.
1283895504: <PipSqueek> 
1283895568: <]3d0g> doesn't tabasco age for a year or more?
1283895568: <PipSqueek> 
1283895577: <acr0nym> 2 years, but, it's very different.
1283895577: <PipSqueek> 
1283895589: <acr0nym> The stuff I'm making just needs a few days for the flavors to blend right.
1283895589: <PipSqueek> 
1283895624: <acr0nym> Tabasco's first step is much like sauerkraut.  Mashed peppers and salt in a barrel for years.
1283895624: <PipSqueek> 
1283895629: <acr0nym> Oh, 3 years, actually, I think.
1283895629: <PipSqueek> 
1283895657: <acr0nym> Yes, 3 years.
1283895657: <PipSqueek> 
1283895772: <]3d0g> makes sense. vinegar takes time as acetobacter is a very slow bacteria.
1283895772: <PipSqueek> 
1283895941: <acr0nym> Until recently, all peppers were grown on Avery Island. While a small portion of the crop is still grown there, the bulk of the crop is now grown in Central and South America, where the weather and the availability of farmland allow more predictable and larger year-round supply of peppers. This also helps to ensure the supply of peppers should something happen to the crop at a particular location (such as a hurricane). Regardless, all seeds are still grown 
1283895941: <PipSqueek> 
1283895947: <acr0nym> Following company tradition, the peppers are handpicked. To determine ripeness, peppers are checked with a little red stick, or le petit bton rouge, that each worker carries. Those peppers not matching the color of the stick are not harvested. Peppers are ground into "mash" the same day they are harvested, placed in white oak barrels (aging barrels previously used for bourbon whiskey) with salt, and sent to warehouses on Avery Island for a three-year aging

1284482824: <tinfoil_> Lalala
1284482824: <PipSqueek> 
1284482991: <tinfoil_> Noticed something in come impact client side exploits while using CORE Impact
1284482991: <PipSqueek> 
1284483021: <tinfoil_> They have Adobe Flash exploits for Windows, OSX, *AND* Linux
1284483021: <PipSqueek> 
1284483037: <tinfoil_> Very cute :-)
1284483038: <PipSqueek> 
1284483067: <tinfoil_> Once they get into your machine, they can pivot (use your machine to attack other machines) or escalate local privledges using local vulns
1284483067: <PipSqueek> 
1284483165: <tinfoil_> The nice thing is, Core can pack multiple exploits into a single client side attack, so it doesn't matter what architecture you're browsing from, if your flash is vulnerable (more like your Flash *IS* vulnerable), they can own your machine.
1284483165: <PipSqueek> 
1284483208: <tinfoil_> Of course, none of this is new per say
1284483208: <PipSqueek> 
1284483235: <tinfoil_> but pretty much if it's in a click-and-exploit package, you know the big time spammers and bot-net people have to be using it by now.
1284483235: <PipSqueek> 
1284484891: <dp> tinfoil_: you've convinced me.  bitlbee is the way to go
1284484891: <PipSqueek> 
1284487029: <tinfoil_> It's far from perfect, but it works
1284487029: <PipSqueek> 
1284487374: <dp> agreed
1284487374: <PipSqueek> 
1284491349: <dp> if I have a running box, can I plug in a SATA drive, or does it have to be a "hot-swap" drive?
1284491349: <PipSqueek> 
1284491366: <tinfoil_> Oh wow, you can force local passwords to be hashed with SHA512 now?  Neat :-)
1284491366: <PipSqueek> 
1284491380: <tinfoil_> Ohh, good question, dunno but want to
1284491380: <PipSqueek>

1284491611: <PipSqueek>

1284491617: <PipSqueek> 
1284491620: <dp> not the drive
1284491620: <PipSqueek>

1284495358: <PipSqueek>

1284495376: <PipSqueek> 
1284495384: <]3d0g> route is shorter :)
1284495384: <PipSqueek> 
1284495603: <TeleCon> Doesn't work on Solaris though.
1284495603: <PipSqueek> 
1284495697: <tinfoil_> Use the solution that works for more hosts ;-)
1284495697: <PipSqueek> 
1284495748: <]3d0g> Solaris is dead Jim. Move along.
1284495748: <PipSqueek> 
1284495890: <tinfoil_> sadly, not completley
1284495890: <PipSqueek> 
1284495923: <tinfoil_> We have _2_ solaris machines in our envirionment because the software the group claimed they "needed" didn't run on linux
1284495923: <PipSqueek> 
1284495961: <]3d0g> And banks still use OS/2 for ATMs. Still a dead OS.
1284495961: <PipSqueek> 
1284496200: <tinfoil_> Regardless how dead it is, it's still useful knowledge to know in the event you do run across it.  Overspecialize and you breed in weakness
1284496200: <PipSqueek> 
1284496208: <tinfoil_> Required, no
1284496208: <PipSqueek> 
1284496212: <tinfoil_> Handy, yes
1284496212: <PipSqueek>

1284496221: <PipSqueek>

1284496327: <PipSqueek>

1284496342: <PipSqueek> 
1284496346: <tinfoil_> It's acceptable to be old in IT again
1284496346: <PipSqueek> 
1284496355: <]3d0g> RPG too.
1284496355: <PipSqueek> 
1284496394: <tinfoil_> That's not meant as a poke at ]3d0g either, it's true
1284496394: <PipSqueek> 
1284496446: <tinfoil_> Remember in the dot com era, people would often ignore 40+somethings
1284496446: <PipSqueek> 
1284496457: <tinfoil_> and prefer the input of 20 somethings
1284496457: <PipSqueek> 
1284496458: <TeleCon> not a poke at ]3d0g, but definitely at TC.
1284496458: <PipSqueek>

1284503710: <PipSqueek> 
1284503770: <tinfoil_> We notified everyone who had a computer with such software asking them to remove the specific programs or come to an IT person who will remove it no questions asked.
1284503770: <PipSqueek> 
1284503809: <tinfoil_> We then created a banner that would pop up on their computer and render it unusable unless they clicked a checkbox to agree to remove the software.

1284568676: <PipSqueek> 
1284568681: <acr0nym> tinfoil_: He meant pyro shoot....  Heh.
1284568681: <PipSqueek> 
1284568682: <tinfoil_> for a party
1284568682: <PipSqueek> 
1284568687: <tinfoil_> Oh :-)
1284568687: <PipSqueek> 
1284568791: <tinfoil_> That would be fun too :-)
1284568791: <PipSqueek> 
1284568820: <tinfoil_> FYI - the higher the ISO the noisier the sensor will be.  Try iso 400 or lower and longer exposure for fireworks.  :-)
1284568820: <PipSqueek> 
1284568839: <tinfoil_> I could be wrong though

1284568858: <PipSqueek> 
1284568910: <tinfoil_> Where's the aperture?
1284568910: <PipSqueek> 
1284568919: <tinfoil_> It's not in the EXIF
1284568919: <PipSqueek>

1284568935: <tinfoil_> What F/stop?
1284568935: <PipSqueek> 
1284568960: <]3d0g> lot of grain in that pick, but it actually enhances the effect. 
1284568960: <PipSqueek> 
1284568990: <acr0nym> I don't think it is actually grain as much as you think.  Look at the smoke, for example, in this one: http://www.acr0nym.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_itemId=3911&g2_imageViewsIndex=1
1284568990: <PipSqueek> http://ln-s.net/7d2S (DSC_3038)

1284569040: <PipSqueek>

1284569055: <PipSqueek> 
1284569067: <]3d0g> just sayin' NOT a bad thing
1284569067: <PipSqueek> 
1284569089: <]3d0g> high ISO can be used to good effet
1284569089: <PipSqueek> 
1284569097: <tinfoil_> Yes :-)
1284569097: <PipSqueek>

1284571093: <PipSqueek> 
1284571178: <tinfoil_> No no no... You got it wrong.   Anyone who was in the navy is used to being fucked.  In general.  Not fucking.  :-)

1284572527: <PipSqueek>

1284572598: <PipSqueek>

1284572625: <PipSqueek> 
1284572661: <tinfoil_> I disagree with "shadowless"   It actually creates a nice rim shadow when used as the key light
1284572661: <PipSqueek> 
1284572831: <fbx> not orbis. Orbis.
1284572831: <PipSqueek>

1284572837: <PipSqueek> 
1284573088: <acr0nym> I think that "shadowless" comes in pretty heavily for macro work.
1284573088: <PipSqueek> 
1284573092: <acr0nym> Which is pretty true.
1284573092: <PipSqueek> 
1284573140: <dp> doesn't matter.  either Orbis or orbis is the 6th one down
1284573140: <PipSqueek>

1284573758: <acr0nym> Cool.
1284573758: <PipSqueek> 
1284573868: <tinfoil_> Also he created a softbox out of an xmas ornament, which envelopes the slides with very soft light

1284576208: <acr0nym> Yeah, the lyrics suck, though.  "To die unsung would really bring you down"?

1284666096: <fbx> i just realized i have some doofus named solsberry in my group who doesn't play this anymore. ever heard of him?
1284666096: <PipSqueek> 
1284666437: <dp> hahaha
1284666437: <PipSqueek> 
1284666451: <dp> said solsberry is actually forcibly removing himself from facebook
1284666451: <PipSqueek> 
1284666468: <dp> it's funny
1284666468: <PipSqueek> 
1284666472: <dp> Google doesn't scare me
1284666472: <PipSqueek> 
1284666482: <dp> Micro$oft doesn't scare me
1284666482: <PipSqueek> 
1284666493: <dp> Facebook?  They scare the *shit* outta me
1284666493: <PipSqueek> 
1284666499: <dp> talk about the fuckin evil empire
1284666499: <PipSqueek> 
1284666632: <acr0nym> As opposed to Zynga?  Heh.
1284666632: <PipSqueek> 
1284666663: <dp> meh.  Zynga's just profiting offa the evil empire
1284666663: <PipSqueek> 
1284666676: <acr0nym> Not if you read the last big round of stories about 'em...
1284666676: <PipSqueek> 
1284666680: <dp> they're not inherently evil
1284666680: <PipSqueek> 
1284666699: <dp> but, not being on facebook means no Zynga either
1284666699: <PipSqueek> 
1284666763: <acr0nym> Just a fun little reminder for everyone: http://www.usdebtclock.org/
1284666763: <PipSqueek> 
1284666855: <dp> please note that US Federal spending is going *down*
1284666855: <PipSqueek> 
1284666865: <dp> as is the Budget Deficit
1284666865: <PipSqueek> 
1284666947: <dp> at the current rate the budget deficit is going down, it'll be 2053 before we hit '0'
1284666947: <PipSqueek> 
1284666967: <acr0nym> I don't really care.  I was mostly using you as a wind-up toy.  Thanks, you were perfect.

1284669845: <PipSqueek> 
1284669849: <acr0nym> No kidding.
1284669849: <PipSqueek> 
1284669880: <acr0nym> Although, those, for one thing, it's probably because they were RIDICULOUSLY expensive, and I don't think Oakley likes dropping the price.
1284669880: <PipSqueek> 
1284669886: <acr0nym> They'd rather kill 'em off.
1284669886: <PipSqueek> 
1284669894: <acr0nym> Than admit a pricing mistake.
1284669894: <PipSqueek>

1284745767: <PipSqueek> 
1284745801: <fbx> so if the data doesn't match...is the problem of replication, or something worse?
1284745801: <PipSqueek>
